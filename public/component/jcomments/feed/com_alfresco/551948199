			<description><![CDATA[Happiness is a natural, innate quality of a soul. It never leaves us. Souls are naturally happy. However, we can block the energy of happiness when we forget about the soul and try to find happiness in the world. There are many nice people and things in the world, but wanting them to make us happy eventually leads to disappointment. To find your smile again, look inside. Learn about the qualities of the soul and how to access them. Learn how to connect with the Supreme Soul who is ever blissful. These topics are covered in the introductory courses offered at Brahma Kumaris centres. There is never any charge.]]></description>
