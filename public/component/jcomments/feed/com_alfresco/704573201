			<description><![CDATA[Dear Dadi ma Each and every human beings including other living things have God in their heart . So, We should not be rude and brutal towards any things . By uttering sweet words, we can win the heart of our enemies again and all over again, let alone friends .If we talk and converse with anybody don't dare to see the physicality but observe the commonalities between ourselves.What are the commonalities between ourselves ? That is-we have the permanent pains in our hearts, we are chasing the happiness in a hope that one day we shall be able to catch it.So be compassionate.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[It is all well when I am stable and centered. But I find that it require attention and regular practice; meditation. I strat well in the morning and as soon as I go into action and interaction I forget all. Even 1 hour alarm sometime do not come to any help. Now I understand that lifestyle change is very much required but it require more strength. Still I keep on faith that " Jyotir bindu hi torega maya moha ka khela."Om Shanti.]]></description>
