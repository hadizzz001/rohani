			<description><![CDATA[I made this for my partner and his daughter for his birthday - both are 'particular' eaters. This means I usually leave the cooking to him. :) They both LOVED the burgers! My mixture had more portabello mushrooms and it ended up being pretty wet - I did not know exactly how to tell until they were in the pan...and hard to flip w/out falling apart. Still, even crumbly from moisture, they were still a hit. Even the crumbs were eaten. So happy.I also made the coconut dessert recipe - from another video on this site.]]></description>
