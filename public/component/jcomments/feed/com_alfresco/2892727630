			<description><![CDATA[Kamlish:  The light of the subtle region is white.  This is a 'world' of thought and movement and no sound, you are connecting with your subtle self and this is a stage from which you can 'enter' into the region of red/golden light which is the home of souls and God, the incaporeal world, the 'land beyond sound'.  As your meditation becomes deeper you can experience the incaporeal stage in the home of red light.  ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Nan:  Looking after a family. especially young childern can be very tiering, but also rewarding.  To find a little time for the self is also important, even if it is 5 or 10 mins.  If we keep ourseves well and happy this also benefits all members of our family.  It is a case of giving it priority. Even if we don't put aside time daily we can practice staying light and drawing might from the Supreme as we walk and move around.  Giving and receiving encouragement is good, but expecting it will only bring sorrow when we don't receive it.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Aishi Sahu:  As you say there is much injustice in this world. A powerul way to bring about change is to empower the self with spiritual wisdom and practice.  Rajayoga is a very good way to do this.  When we bring spiritual truth into our lives it transforms the way we respond to things and gives us the power to decern - including when to act and when not to act.  Sometimes it is better to speak and sometimes better to stay in silence.  The silence that comes from connecting to our true selves and to God brings benefit through the power of the mind, and can make real change happen.  Subtle vibrations can be more powerful than action. When we act with spiritual wisdom our actions will have power imbued in them. Our aim is for everyone in the world to live in diginity an happiness.  When we learn to respect ourselves and other beings this will bring the change that we all want.  ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dear Dadiji - I always try to feel good now because I have understood that feeling good makes my life good. I know feeling and thinking good attracts the same. If I feel good then I will attract more situations, events and people who will give me more and more reasons to feel good and remain happy. Whenever I am upset I try my best to divert my thinking towards any good event so that I can feel good to attract in return some good events because if I continue to be upset then more events will appear which will make me more upset. It is difficult but try because it is for our good only.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[The head on fire is the heart on fire and the heart on fire is the head on fire. Thought and feelings need to be calm, peaceful and pure at all times to keep the head and heart cool. Never think negative but ever think positive is the right practice. Think thoughts of peace to recieve a cool head and heart.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I have a question and I have complete faith that I can get answer from this forum.In the present women are falling prey to injustice inside and outside home.In that case do we need to raise voice?Do we struggle for justice?or can we do something with the power of rajayoga?I am confused if these types of problems can be dealt with silence?If we raise a voice is it a sin?]]></description>
