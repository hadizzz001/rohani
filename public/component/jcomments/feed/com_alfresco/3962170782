			<description><![CDATA[Thank you Dadi.Most of what I study from the BKs is from our local website and "at Home" in this Home. I was born in Argentina and yet I can communicate in English and read your messages and keep learning and make distances disappear. This must be some karmic account that I have finally paid ;). I am on the other side of the world and the possibilities of growing spiritually are so easy now. Videos, audios, messages from Dadi... you name it. Gratitude in every form I know is traveling to every soul this moment from my grateful soul.]]></description>
