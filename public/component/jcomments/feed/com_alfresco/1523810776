			<description><![CDATA[when you become aware about your true self. when you start to see yourself as a soul,detached from this body,detached from this birth only and when you get to know your true father i.e the almighty being, this thought automatically elevates your consciousness.The thought that i am the child of the supreme and he loves me unconditionally and this love is eternal,unperishable and that i get this fortune every kalp cycle makes you feel so light and blissfull. Thankyou Dadi Janki]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Yes, I am not only special but fortunate to be in this Godly knowledge where I find true comfort from the Comforter of Hearts. My true experience is that when I stay in remembrance of Baba (God) while doing any task, even the most difficult task becomes easy and everything falls in place. I don't even feel tired but happy and the thought that God is with me gives me supersensuous joy. Billion thanks to sweet sweet Baba.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[God doesn't create 'devils'.  We are the ones who become devilish through putting into practice the vices.  God gives us shreemat - elevated directions - to take us out of vice and shows us how to imbibe virtues and spiritual power so that our behaviour becomes devine.  The choice is ours.  Living a life which is filled with virtues brings happiness to ourselves and thoes in our contact, inspiring us to create a better world for all.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Pratik:  How to become divine: By connecting to the Ever Pure One, the source of all divininty, this connection - yoga is the remmbrance of who we really are and who God is.  When we consider ourselves to be a soul we get on the 'same wave length' which is a very subtle conciousness, and remember the Supreme Soul, the One Source of pure energy.  In this connection, we can receive the spiritual power, drop by drop, to become pure.  This practice also helps us to decern right actions, and so we perform actions which uplift the self and others, ]]></description>
