			<description><![CDATA[Kamlesh: Om shanti. Regarding meals there are a number of things we do to remove negative vibrations. In selecting the food that is to be cooked, we select vegetarian recipes. We all know that washing the vegetables and grains before cooking is important. Then as we prepare the meal, we cook with love in the remembrance of God. Once the food is ready to eat we take a few minutes to offer the food to God, fill it with God's power and then enjoy.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Rameshbabu:  Often when we fist try somthing, especially meditation, is is difficult for us to focus as our habit is to be distracted by the world, or our own thoghts.  It is necessary to cultivate this practice by paying attention without tension and the depth of our experience will increase.  So we need determination, patience and practice.  Perhpas you would like to take up this practice of Raj Yoga once again with renewed energy and focus and see the results.]]></description>
