			<description><![CDATA[thank u dadiji.ur words of thought feeling me that its come from god. If u do every work only think that god watch u. the work is not work its transform in to divine works.and i have experienced that......such a great experience.sometimes in ur office, in ur exam u have not got full marks, n u assure that u have done every work or exam in front of god. so y we got minimum marks? it happens because of u think there is a God who will correct everything. This is wrong as God helps those who help themselves. so recognise ur inner strength. its possible only when u do meditation. for this you can visit the brahma kumaris.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om shanti. What i feel is, when you consider God is with you when you are doing anything, at that time we should think twice.  It may be an assumption that god is in front of us and watching us.  But it will keep us doing things in proper and divine order.  We can not be God but as we are tiny "aunsh" particle of the supreme soul we can explore in the same way..!!!!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Now a days i practice early morning meditation.  Dadiji you have taught me how to nourish the soul with wonderful words; these words of yours help me to overcome my own negative thoughts which entangle me throughout the day. Sometimes our past incidents are so crude and intolerable but as you say Dadi -- keep God in-front of us and we can transform  many bad experiences.  Thanks Dadiji for guiding us .om shanti]]></description>
