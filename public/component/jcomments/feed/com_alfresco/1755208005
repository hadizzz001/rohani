			<description><![CDATA[Manvi: Everything is simple to understand.  Putting it into practice takes attention and determination. If the person or situation comes in front of you every day . . . this is a wonderful opportunity to practice the spiritual understanding that you have heard.  If every day we practice something . . . we will definitely improve until we have mastered what it is we are learning.  Actually situations like this are a gift, as they allow us every day to see how strong we have become, the extent to which we have become a master of our minds/or not.  They are test papers . . . which if we pass not only empower us, but also bring benefit to the person or circumstance we are being tested by.  So the answer to what you can do . . . is to keep practicing 'om shant'  I am a peaceful soul.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Varsha:  It is easy and soothing to listen.  It is easy to advise and motivate others.  Why?  Because we are detached (we are not involved).  Try stepping back and looking at the situation, in a detached way.  What really was the situation, is there something I can do to rectify it?  If not, look for the lessons to be learned, and let go. The way that we think is habitual, if we keep thinking of our failures and problems the mind becomes heavy, confused and is unable to find solutions.   ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Sheila Bala: When we hear spiritual knowledge and connect to it we feel very inspired and happy.  However in order to see any lasting change we need to put these teachings into practice outside the classroom.  As we do this we practically begin to empower ourselves and undersand ourselves, our relationships and the world better.  The practice of meditation quietens the mind and focuses the mind away from everyday concerns so you can connect to your 'real' self - the spirit, the soul, and you begin to 'hear' your own inner voice.]]></description>
