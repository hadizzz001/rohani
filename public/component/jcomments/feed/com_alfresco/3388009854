			<description><![CDATA[Misha:  A pure and good action is when we do something with love.  Love that comes from a pure place inside where we only want to give; to bring benefit to another and not to get anything in return -- So we give without expectation, just because we love.  If we do something 'good' with a desire to get something from another, then the return of that action will inevitably be mixed with sorrow because our expectation was not returned - we did not get what we wanted. We gave in order to get (even subtly) and we did not get, and so the result is a feeling of sorrow.  God had nothing to do with it, it was our action, and we revived the return of that action.God doesn't make a decision to give us happiness and sorrow, God is our Father and He only wants happiness for His children - He teaches us how to do elevated actions so that we can receive happiness.  The decision is ours, as to what sort of action we do, and the result (happiness or sorrow) depends on that decision/action.  We may lack the power to do elevated, pure, actions and this is why we remember God and take the opportunity to receive power from God to do as he guides -- but the choice is ours.  ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[When you keep on trying to elevate others through your goodwishes and action it will go on adding into your karmic account. Though not for want of happiness you should work, but with pure mind and as an agent of God, keeping him in front of you, when you work for empowerment of others, no doubt god will be there supporting your cause. He himself will work for you. The world will be elevated and you will experience spiritual bliss and happiness. Faith in god, good wishes to others and empowerment of the week souls all these 3 combined together will work in a miraculous manner and bring wonders.]]></description>
