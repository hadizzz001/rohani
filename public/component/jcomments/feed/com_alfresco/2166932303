			<description><![CDATA[Anne:  Many of us find it difficult to let go of old ways of thinking, after all we have buillt them up over many years and they have become part of our personality.  One way to help with this is to focus on cultivating the new positive habits.  Whatever we focus on grows.  We also need to have determination that I do not want to think in this old way and when these thougths come up, change them immediately, they will come because they are used to coming, but as we focus more and more on the positive, the negative will melt away.  This kind of negative thinking is aquired, (from circumstances, relationships etc.) it is not really who we are and so by identifying with the positive, loving, healing, nurturing thoughts we connect back to the pure and powerful being that we origionaly were.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om Shanti! While I understand that in order to cultivate new positive habits, we must discard the old ones. However, this is the hardest thing for me to do. How do you go about discarding old memories, especially the ones that are so full of pain, sorrow, fear and trauma. I am trying very hard to let go, however I feel like my mind is like a revolving door. The same thoughts and emotions come and go like a revolving door. They never quite leave my side and I find myself in so much frustration, pain and fear that these aweful thoughts will never me. Please help me guide through this.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om Shanti. I think your teaching are so important. My suggestion is to go further than teaching the older generation and go forcefully to teaching them young. I would appreciate the BK team to reach the locations in Soweto and groom our kids - who have lost its way. Some due to poverty and lack of guidance - Parents being absent because they lost life due to HIV. Om Shanti]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om Shanti! Very true said dear Dadiji. As in the presence of light, darkness cannot exist, in the same way, in the presence of the positive, the negative has to disappear. We can only be renewed by transcending our old self (ego based) which was full of darkness and influenced by Maya (illusion).]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[newness is about dropping the old shoe of negative thinking, feelings, words, actions and wearing the new shoe of positive thoughts, feelings, words and deeds. The new is positive, fresh and should be owned while the old is to be discarded. Replace all negative ways to positive ways is newness. Newness is the art of consciously creating only positive thoughts and feelings through out the day and days to come. Newness is remembrance of the new and the ever-new Baba. Newness is inner and outer cleanliness. Lets be new for the new age or new world is at hand for only the new.]]></description>
