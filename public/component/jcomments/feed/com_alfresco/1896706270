			<description><![CDATA[I have another doubt...after we are done meditating and we have had a wonderful experience....and it feels great and then we come back to the day-to-day world and then we begin to observe our behaviour with others or our outlook towards something and realise that it's not in harmony with our inner self...so how do we handle it? And another question, where should we steer the thoughts? To something pleasant, that I like thinking about...or thinking about the same situation in a different way?Also, could you please give some more tips to practise S.O.S? I am veryyy thankful for this article !!!! :D:)]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[This is a very useful article, a must read I would say. What I liked the most is the thought that my feelings and thoughts are malleable and in my control. I am definitely going to try and implement the thought management formula (Stop-Observe-Switch) in my thinking process. Thanks a lot for such a good article!]]></description>
