			<description><![CDATA[Rajesh: On an interpersonal level, if we don’t forgive someone then weremain trapped by them.  First weexperience the sorrow they initially caused us and then by holding on to thesituation, or feelings of dislike, we remain trapped in that sorrow.  It is better for us to become free, byforgiving and forgetting, it is also a generous act on our part.  Giving always brings happiness.  In terms of countries forgiving othercountries . . . dialogue to understand each others perspective would also bringabout faster resolution and peace.  War onlycreates more sorrow and violence.  If wewant to ‘teach others lessons’ then the best way to do this is to inspireothers to follow our good example, forcing others to do as we want only breedsfear and contempt and will inevitably have its own negative repercussionsforcing us then to protect our borders. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[The trials of life bring conflict into all of our minds - happiness is a decision, sometimes difficult, that we have to make every day. We are all souls that have been born into material bodies to learn...life is the longest schooling that any of us undertake! We begin to realise that the struggle to have correct thoughts and correct actions is worth it when we feel that our mood is more stable and our inner happiness develops greater strength. God bless all of us and I send love to all souls that walk the path. Meditating upon love and soul-consciousness has changed my life for the better.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Neeru: It is difficult when you do not have your family around youfor company.  But your true parent – God isalways available to give you company and comfort, you just need to remember Godwho is just a thought away.  With this remembranceyou will receive strength you need to face the situation you find yourself in.  There are always solutions you just need tomove forward step by step with God as your companion.  By taking small steps and creating solutionsyour self confidence will also increase and things will start to move forward.  If you wish to connect to a center in NewZealand, go to “Where are We” and then “Locations Near You” on this website andthey will help you to deepen your practice of meditation which will make iteasier to connect with God, and they also have different activities which youcould join in.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I regularly watch your programme on TV and am deeply impressed, but I have some query. Yesterday Shivani didi told us that if we want happiness we should forgive others for their mischief. If it is true, why did Rama not forgive Ravana, Pandava  not forgive Kaurva. They were also very very intelligent saint/god and made exploratory lessons to the public. Why every country formed police force, why do countries put their soliders on the border to save their country. It means we should teach lessons to the dirty persons and encourage them not to do dirty works. Please let me know these things.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dearest Dadi Ji, Thank you for such a beautiful teaching that sorrow and happiness comes from within, and is not found from external sources. As souls we have forgotten this by the distractions we face in our daily lives and through you we are reminded to follow our true purpose. Please bless us all.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Thanks Dadiji for making us believe that happiness is inside us.  But its a very subtle inside, as we have thought mere bhagyme to yeses hona hi tha ,mere sath hin yesa nkyuon hota hey, actually if we start to have these types of thoughts nobody is going to help us. Sometimes we feel TV, music, the computer is our friend, but we forget they are all external gadgets, they have been made with the improvement of science to keep our mind busy for sometime, but suppose the current is switched off -  what will happen?  So we should always have constant faith in God (Shiv Baba), to think of Him as the constant One.]]></description>
