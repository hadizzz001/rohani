			<description><![CDATA[I just turned 23 and I already feel a little exhausted of almost everything in life, not being able to manage relationship with parents, the fact that I have too many friends and not a single one I can truely tell what I really feel inside but thereâ€™s this need to talk and discuss and let out but I cannot do it. I lose track of what I really wanted to say. I have this strong feeling I need to quit my job and dedicate myself to just a field where I can help people like me and others.]]></description>
