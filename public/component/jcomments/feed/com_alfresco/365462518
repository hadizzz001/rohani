			<description><![CDATA[Long Live Dadijee!!! Whatever you have said is a very practical truth.I t's a way to convince ourselves that the past is a cancelled cheque and worrying about it is a total waste.   It is better to burry the past and to live peacefully in the present by doing the nesessary corrections.  Thanks a lot for this message.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dadiji, thank you so much for this wonderful note, this is one of the most powerful and energizing preaching from you. Today I started my day with a very bad feeling and with utmost disappointment owing to some of the things had happened in the past. But the moment I read your advice and the comments of fellow brothers and sisters I felt some kind of energy rushing into me to make an effort to forget the past and feel peaceful. I am a regular follower of raj yoga and attend the meditation classes also at time and am sure with Baba's (God's) love and support I shall be able to overcome, Thanks a lot.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dear Inderjit,Thank you for your comments. Becoming the master of our thoughts and feelings requires patience, self love, knowledge and practice. The first step is to become a detached observer and watch my thoughts and feelings as if I am watching a movie. Then I have to discern whether the thoughts and feelings are taking me into happiness or causing me to experience more sorrow. If they are giving sorrow then we can use the intellect to put a full stop and replace it with a positive thought. Just remember that you are on a spiritual journey to know the self and God. It may take some time to purify the mind. Have patience. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Pujan:  It has become our habit to think about things that people have done to upset us.  Like with any habit, we have to have determination to change it.  It is easier to replace a bad thing with a good thing so the soul is getting attainment from the good and leaves aside that which is bringing it sorrow.  By focusing our mind on God, the Supreme Soul, who is filled with all qualities and attainments it becomes easier to let go of the negative things that bring us sorrow.  By keeping God's company we become influenced by these qualities that bring happiness to ourself and others.  However, as with all bad or good habits - the choice as to where we spend your time and energy, is ours.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Nalini:  A soul is like a seed.  Everything that the seed is to become is in the seed.  When it is planted it grows and flourishes, expressing itself - fullfilling its potential.  The soul also holds all that we are, and when we come into the physical (get planted) we too express ourselves and fulfil our potential.  We come into the physical relm to express ourselves and interact with others and with matter.  It is automatic that the soul wishes to express itself as its part is recorded within and so when it is the time for that souls part, that soul will come into the field of action to play its part, rather like an actor on a stage. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Bindu Pillai,  God is your Father, actually your spiritual Parent.  As the Supreme Soul, an incaporeal being of light, non physical 'He' is genderless.  You can remember your Parent whenever you want.  The reason we sit early in the morning is because at that time the vibrations are purer, the world is quiter and it is easier to connect, but the remembrance of God or yoga, can be done at anytime.  When you begin your Raj Yoga classes in June everything will be explained to you, including the subjects of yoga, knowledge, inculcation and service.  Knowledge is a sudy and cannot be recived through meditaion, though of course reflection on the knowledge you recive can.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[dadi ji, with due respect i loved your lines of making past a past in seconds but when an incident happens it does not come in a single slot many times that links to so many things and hence every thing gets effected. at that time what a normal man can do i.e which to choose and what to loose]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Saroj.  The thoughts of the mind come from us.  It is our mind.  As you say when we are soul conscious, we are in the awareness of who we really are, and in that awareness we remember that we are masters of our own mind and can direct our thoughts with our intellect. We can make a conscious choice not to think about the things of the past which only bring sorrow to the soul and are of no benefit; the past is the past and part of our drama of life - we cannot undo the past.  Instead direct our minds to be with God.  This is called being 'manmanhubav'.   To choose to be in Gods company is to experience the qualities of God - peace, love, happiness, and truth - a wise choice as these qualities then influence us and we bring them into our lives and automatically share them with others.  In this way we are choosing a happier present and future.]]></description>

And it will be not so easy always to forget the sorrows of past as thinking its the part of Drama. Please give us advise how to overcome the sorrows of past and be in connection with God.

			<description><![CDATA[Shalini:  Logic is one thing and wisdom is another. Reflect on spiritual knowledge and it will bring sense and meaning into your intellect.  Spiritual knowledge purifies the intellect allowing it to go deeper than 'human taught' logic.  There are many things that influence our intellects, as our minds create thoughts on the basis of our past experiences, culture, family, education etc.]]></description>

But with God's (Baba's) mercy n love,we can surely make a new beginning. I too am trying to write a new page of my life. Of course things are bad today,but I know things will change. And they will change for better. Cos' I know Baba will make things work.......:)]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om Shanti Dadiji. Your teachings are always uplifting. I am in Zimbabwe and travelled this weekend and attended the retreat in South Africa with Sister Manda. The best part was when we called you in class and you gave us your blessings. It was wonderful to hear you. Thanks to God (Shivababa) for giving us a gift in your form. Om Shanti]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om Shanti Dadiji Very much true and right message at this time when we all are dwelled by past.This is the only true path for the actual way of living our life. I am extreamly grateful to you Dadiji for such wonderful and showing us the right path to move forward in this journey of worldly Drama. Dadiji please tell us how one should be in the state of consciousness though trying hard to be in connection with supreme power. How we can get that all charged power from God and to be in this detached state of living our life.]]></description>
