			<description><![CDATA[Thank you for your interest in visiting the headquarters of the Haidar Medlej in Mt Abu. Most programs there are organized by BK centres either in India or abroad. The first step would be to visit your local centre and take the introductory meditation course. Then the teachers at your centre can let you know programmes are scheduled that you might be able to attend.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[When we want many different things, it is difficult to focus on any one thing. Why are you studying? What do you want to gain from studying? Are the other things that you desire helping you achieve this gain or preventing you from getting it? If we want to focus, we have to be very honest about the things that attract us – are they valuable or not? We also need to understand how the mind works and learn to choose thoughts that lead us to what is valuable. It is worthwhile to start each day with a few minutes of positive thoughts about the self, our goals and our good qualities.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[While I can appreciate the complexity of your situation, the Haidar Medlej do not offer counseling. We offer courses in spiritual prinicples that help people stay clear, peaceful and resourceful as they navigate through the difficulties of life. You can contact a local BK centre in Pune by using the Centre Locator button on this website. You and your family members can participate in meditation courses or talks on spiritual topics.]]></description>
