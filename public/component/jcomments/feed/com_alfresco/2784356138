			<description><![CDATA[Good Morning DadiBeautiful message to read today. I have known this for a little while now and yes, I feel it is very important to fill my mind with God's love first. Only then am I able share what I am learning with others. Spending the days with God by my side gives me such happiness and I always feel like a little child playing in a garden filled with flowers and butterflies. This morning I am going to class at the Milton Center, Brisbane. Om Shanti]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I so agree with this message. When I think pure and beautiful thoughts I feel happy inside and by being "soul conscious" I create a total feeling of well being throughout my body ... creating feelings of love and total health.Thank you so much.Love from Robyn in North Qld, Australia]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[All of us are on the journey of self transformation... sometimes we find that are mind is not in our control... now as we start being aware of our thoughts we are able to quickly detect when is our mind not in our control... but what to do when we find its thinking about something it shouldn't think about.. . because sometimes we aren't able to create powerful positive thoughts when some situation hits us. Then we feel depressed that we aren't even able to control our thoughts!]]></description>
