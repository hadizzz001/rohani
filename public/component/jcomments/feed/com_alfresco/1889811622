			<description><![CDATA[Yumii:  Being peaceful, which is our true nature, is a light and joyful experience and doesn't mean that we have to sit in one place and be still.  Because we are connected to the truth that we really are the soul is full and content.  Being peaceful makes us powerful and strong because we are then able to face life in a calm and stable way and see things clearly without getting affected by others behavior  We have the patience and the love to understand them, and uplift them.  Being peaceful allows us to enjoy the wonder of this world without getting attached to things and people which will cause us sorrow.  Being peaceful is not boring . . . but gives us the ability to live life to the full and share it with others with a vision of brotherhood and love. So enjoy your peaceful life and have fun.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om shantiRespected Dadiji,I totally agree with your enlightening message. Dadi,I love the teachings of bhramakumaris and try to apply them in my daily life. But being a teenager,I am always pressurized by my parents and everyone else. Though I try not to get affected,but,yet their moodswings always shatters me.And I can't help myself from getting angry. So,Dadi how can I remind myself that I am a peaceful being when someone is throwing tantrums at me????And being soul-concious means remaining peaceful and calm,then how can we enjoy beautiful worldly things?Actually,I feel remaining peaceful sometimes prevents me from having fun.Should we not have fun and enjoy???]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Sonia,  One of the aims of meditation is to bring the peace that you experience in meditation into your everyday life, so that while you look after your household, children, cook, go to work etc. you are doing it in a state of peace, which will bring happiness to yourself, to your family, and work colleagues.  Peace is our natural state of being, so connecting with this peace in meditation reminds us who we are, we can then bring that awareness into our everyday activities, perhaps see things from a different perspective, allowing us to make new choices.  So if everyone were to go into a state of peace, the world would certainly be a better place with people making peaceful more equitable choices that bring benefit to all]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I understand the benefit of being in peace and meditation. I enjoy it tremendously but at the same time, I need to go to work, support family, take care of households chores etc. My only question is, if everyone goes into state of peace, who will take care of the worldly matters. We still get hungry, need a roof and clothes. Who can people turn to for their daily necessities?]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[In the world we are living in, we often forget that success is our godly birth right. We cannot lose! We can only live the illusion of loosing. When we remember this and take our right, we remain in our courage and stay in the stage of pleasure?]]></description>
