			<description><![CDATA[Kraaltje:  As with any relationship it takes time tobuild.  Step by step.  Get to know who God is and tune to the samewave length.  God is a spiritual non-physicalbeing and if I am His child, then so am I. By experiencing this awareness we can connect to God, our spiritualparent and spend time in His company, listening to His ‘golden words, spoken insilence.  It is worth deciding to havefaith and trust in the self and God and then see the results.  All relationships need a bit of faith andtrust as they develop.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Many thanks for sharing. I like a lot the sentence "Make yourself right first!" First me, then the world. Instead of what I usually did: First you and perhaps me. Now I wander, what is the purest thought for myself at this moment? That I accept that I am a child of God! Somehow, I cannot accept this because I have no trust/faith. What do I need to trust Him? What can I do to trust the 'golden words', live those words and create my golden future?]]></description>
