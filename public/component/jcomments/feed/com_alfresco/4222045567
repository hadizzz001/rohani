			<description><![CDATA[Nilaxi Shah: It can sometimes seem difficult to tell the truth and society oftenspeaks of telling 'white lies' in order to get out of a situationwithout causing sorrow.  However, it is better not to say anything thanto lie.  Stay silent and send them good wishes, which will give themthe power to work out whatever they need to.  We often use the excuseof  'white lies' because we don't want to do something and we lack thecourage to say so.  Real truth actually never gives sorrow, but if wefeel what we are about to say will give sorrow it means that there isno real truth in what we are going to say - it is just a subjectiveopinion.  We very rarely know the complete story - only God knows. Falsehood always makes us feel bad as it leaves a trace on the soul.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[loving dadi, not to lie is little bit difficult because some times that is the only way out of not giving sorrow to other person. truth is bitter and it hurts.lie is not truth, it may not hurt other person and give sorrow, but it does give me a bad feeling. how to handle that?]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[sulekha:  You have a choice in both instances:  You have a choice not to give sorrow and you have a choice not to take sorrow.  If someone is offering you a rotten apple would you take it?  No, because you recognize what they are giving you is not useful and has no value in your life, so you simply don't accept it. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dadi Janki has been the 'light of my life' with her writings in the Companion of God. This message is precise and accurate. Point #5 is very difficult for many of 'Us New Yorkers'  it is something Dadi is cautioning us about----don't criticize others. Point #4 if a commonly accepted 'commitment' would have helped the entire world---many in the world were 'deceived' by lenders/ money groups, etc. Finally, Point #1 was and remains a daily practice that needs personal and careful attention. Listen carefully to others! Listen carefully to yourself! Is sorrow there?]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dearest DadiI am striving for Golden Age now. First within myself. Then I can give it away, share its bliss as I believe once you come to Golden Age, you will never leave it. I imagine the sorrowful souls finding happiness, peacelessness transforming into pure peace. I have many vices and done many hurtful things in my life. That is past. There is a full stop on what I can do nothing about. To my Baba and to you Dadi, I make the commitment to give and take no sorrow, not to lie, steal, deceive or criticize. I also make the commitment to stay in remembrance of my Father always. Om Shanti]]></description>
