			<description><![CDATA[Rajesh:  The first paragraph of Dadi's message gives the key - become humble, become soul concious, pay subtle attention and learn.  There is always somthing to learn from situation, even if it is just not to take the 'rotten fruit' someone gives you.  The experience of meditation and the connection with God gives strength to a 'weak heart' and clears up blockages (in your case, wonded feelings)]]></description>

Body and soul is interactive machines it should always be fresh and health nature, then only a human being come out and see the truth and god.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dear sweet Dadi what is circulating in my spiritual circulation? Checking ourselves as to what we are thinking how we are using the mind.Remembering the father and his love for us clears the blockages. How blessed we are to have God as our companion. Difficulties come, embrace them, understanding that it is to help the soul that I am grow into a deeper relationship with God.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[In life everything happens for a reason. Shivbaba says that what happened is for good, what is happening is for good and what will happen is also for good. This world drama is happening for good. God teaches us how to make our fortune. He is not the one to create our fortune but I the soul am the creater of my great fortune.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Oh Dadi, Such humility, to bow even when someone is critical of you. Only by taking God's help with the power of yoga (meditation) will you be able to achieve this.Thankyou so much for reminding me that the difficulties are a blessing, so embrace them trusting that everything is accurate in the drama. Om Shanti ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Very beautiful reflection! We don't realize sometimes that our spirit is delicate and if don't take care of it as we do with our exterior and physical, it gets blocked. And this blockage could be worst than what we think, if we don't grow spiritually! Thank you for such a beautiful reflection BK Janki. With meditation any blockage with God will be gone!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[The words: It is important to take everything with a good feeling and if the heart has been hurt, it needs healing.My bloodpressure is sometimes high because of things I cannot let go fully. I will follow Dadis advice to take everything with a good feeling and have a good connection with God (Baba). Hopely I dont have to drink any medicine in the future.]]></description>
