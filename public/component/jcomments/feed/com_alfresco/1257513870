			<description><![CDATA[This is one of the wonderful medicine's that science has not yet discovered.  That is to feel great whatever the situation in our life comes. For example someone who has lost his or her dear ones, its very hard to cope, but by going into depression can we bring back the soul?  People come and give sympathy and have empathy for a small span of time, but its only possible to overcome the grief through meditation and constant yoga practice. God says this world is a drama, here every actor has its own role  to play, and will live as long as his part, we cannot say you have to live this long. But it is our choice ow long we grieve.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dadiji.. thanks for such a great idea. I also want to ask you a question. These great words remain in our minds for small time. Then in daily work we forget them and at times we act in the opposite way. Also I have a lack of confidence. Kindly dadiji help me out of this.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dear Dadiji,Om Shanti.We should care for others. But my humble submission is to make differential treatment. As the amicability may be interpreted as weakness or bad intention.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dearest Dadiji,You have always been a great source of inspiration to me. I regularly watch your videos on youtube.On this very specific note I have had the opportunity to meet Bapdada in Mount Abu eight years ago and  understand the BK philosophy. I still don't feel that ecstasy in any BK centres which I feel when I engage my self in the devotional service of Radha Londonisvara iskcon deities. So from your comment it means that it is OK to continue deity worshiping as with my state of happiness I am serving others.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I agree with you. I am 14 years old in class 7, and weakest in my class.  One day I saw Astha  (TV channel with program of BKs) and I realised why I could not get good marks and become top of my class. Now my concentration is higher and my soul is most peaceful and I am more connected to God.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Thank you Dadi Janki for such wise words. Reading this message today has been extremely powerful and therapeutic. I am taking a medical drug called herceptin for secondary breast cancer and was told yesterday that my heart function has decreased. I have been trying to focus on my spiritual consciousness and this message of being happy whatever life throws at us and being free from worry and fear has been very profound and left me thinking about the beauty of who we really are and helped me think about trying to detach my body conscious thoughts and uniting with the God. Om shanti]]></description>
