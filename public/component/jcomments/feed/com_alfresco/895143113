			<description><![CDATA[It is futile to look for happiness and peace within periphery of earthy relationships. But, today’s commercial spirituality does not advocate such harsh views of Chapter XV Geeta, which says a person must develop a sense of disregard to his son, wife, house etc., and sense of detachment from all good and bad incidents including birth & death in family. Target is “Brahmi Stithi”. But, the road to that has to be traveled alone practicing control of mind by detachment..]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I attended the Peace of Mind Retreat (POM) in 2009 and the spiritual experience gained from there followed me all the way and really changed my thoughts to positive. Since then, whenever I faced problem, I sat in silence, recalled sharing from participants and my strong emotions when meditating on the top of the mountain (Baba's rock). And surprisingly, my mind becomes clear and solution comes. ]]></description>
