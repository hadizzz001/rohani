			<description><![CDATA[We are not able to send questions to Sister Shivani but I will try to respond. It sounds like you are a good observer of your inner state. If there is jealousy, or any other negative reaction, fear is at the root of it. Whatever we fear, we unconsciously defend ourselves against. In Raja Yoga we learn to not focus too much on our negative reaction but rather to concentrate on what an ideal response would be. If one particular person pushes our buttons, we can practice seeing that person as a luminous being of light, notice and pay attention to the person’s good qualities, see the self as independent of that person, a detached observer of that person’s energy, and put a lot of effort into responding with whatever positive energy would make the self feel stable and positive.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dear sister Shivani. Thank you for the wisdom. A question arises. When you are aware of a reaction in the emotional centre when a particularly particular person is speaking and you feel it strongly but due to your practice you are able to see it and watch it so that it doesn't overpower you, how do you then work with this to understand what exactly it is? What I have seen so far is that it is due to a perceived threat to ego and that this is probably Fear but may also be jealousy and there is the knowledge that in my speech it causes a different vibration which is unintentional, how can this be stopped? Om Shanti sister.]]></description>
