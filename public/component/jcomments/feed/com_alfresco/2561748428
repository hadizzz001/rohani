			<description><![CDATA[Really a very helping article to understand that how to manage the negative energy to positive one. We should think of everyone as if we are actor in this life drama having the same base (soul) , If we see a person as a soul not as their role, we will never require any anger management, because nobody loves to hurt himself and everyone is a soul (atman). In that case we will respect and love to each other]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om Shanti, I used to practice 2nd categary to control my anger, but for sure it was not a solution to control my anger. I was following Sister Shivani over TV and came to know what's the right way to control your anger (3rd Category) and To be honest I am seriously following this. If any such situation comes I do get angry for a moment but at the same time I try to replace it with some positive thoughts and it's making lot of change in my life and thought process. I used to think why me? At least now that question don't bother me because of your's and Sister Shivani's articles. Thanks Lalit]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[This ia a wonderful articles with practical examples. I, for a very long time, had anger as a way of 'normal' reaction to anything. Until recently, when I deposited my anger with Baba; and I now feel extremely light. What also breeds alongside anger is intolerance and impatience because both the latter traits can lead to anger.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Actually it's true that trying to change others is not only a waste of energy and time, it also make us frustrated and mentally disturbed as well! This article has made me realize that I can't blame myself for another person's bad response. All I can do is to take responsibility for my own response. Thank you for such and enlightening article.    ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA["Response to Dheeraj Bhardwaj".Many thanks for your comments and question, Dheeraj.In our study, we understand that Inner Peace is already there within the soul - it just needs to be emerged and nourished. A way to do this is to make an appointment (at least 10 mins or so) with yourself every morning and every evening to experience Silence Time/Meditation. Allow the thought: "I am a being of Peace, a Peaceful soul" to enter your awareness- and dwell on this for a few minutes.....this awareness is like a key which opens the door to the treasure of Inner Peace. Then try to maintain this awareness as much as possible during the day - and in the evening, again sit down for 10 mins or so and consciously practise Meditation. With systematic regular practice, concentration improves and the experience becomes deeper and longer lasting.......best wishes, and good luck!Yogesh]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I totally agree with the article. I went through the third method and now I'm a happier man then before. But when I talked to some people about your article, some of them told me that they never feel their own inner peace. What can we do in such circumstances to make them more happy?]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Recently, like a pressure cooker that has too much steam inside, I burst into anger at the person who cares for me the most and never ever says a bad word to me. In that fit of anger, within only a few moments, I created such chaos. After that I repented and hated myself like anything for at least an hour. This article has helped me understand where I was wrong. My Ego aggravated the anger!! So now I'm working on controlling both bad traits (ego as well as anger) so that i can live peacefully and let others around me also live peacefully. Thanks to the Almighty for somehow bringing this article in front of my sight.Thanks to Mr. Yogesh for writing it so nicely.]]></description>
