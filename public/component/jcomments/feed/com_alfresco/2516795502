			<description><![CDATA[Chandrashekar:  We all make mistakes, many times knowingly because we are too spiritualy weak to make the effort needed to make good choices.  It is not time making mistakes, it is us.  In order to make less mistakes we need to empower oursleves spiritually.  Meditation is a very good method for this.  Meditation gives us the experience of who we really are and helps us to make good choices from understanding spiritual laws.  In meditation we also learn how to connect to God, who as the source of all that is good, and the Almighty Authority. In this connection we can receive God's power to make the necessary changes.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[First of all thank you Dadi. Our karma is the first and foremost thing in making our life. Good karmas always bring good for us and hence we do not need to do any bad karma for achieving anything in our life. We can all repeat all in this world can enjoy life if we concertrate on good deeds but sorry to say all are not understanding this aspect for which some people suffer for doing wrong deeds for achieving a few materialistic things in the world. Please wake up and enjoy life and let others also enjoy their life.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I agree with each and every sentence said by you. It is your deeds which decide your destiny.The love & blessings which we all get from people around totally help us in some way or the other. Though after reading this people should not just do it because they "have to" but they feel like doing this cause it is called selfless deeds for the betterment of the ones around. Not only do we feel good, ultimately it is the food or medicine(tranquilizer) for the soul to stay healty.Dadiji stay with us always.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om Shanti Dadi ji. Really, its wondeful message. I feel quite happy if I do things honestly & in good manner. I feel very light and happy if I do good things. One thing I want to know Dadi ji, what is good or bad thing? In real life, we generally come across following problem:We need to pay bribe/amount to get some work done either in a hospital to get doctor's appointment appointment or get certificate in govt.office. We are forced to pay money else work will not happen. We are forced to pay though not willingly. Please clarify what to do here? To pay for not to pay?]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Thanks Dadi This post brings out an unseen/not much talked about aspect. It gives me a lesson that living spiritually rather than discussions and thinking would make me happy. Discussions merely give us an insight to the happiness given by spirituality. But it is when we live spiritually, we get the complete happiness-one that is permanent and everlasting. Thanks once again!]]></description>
