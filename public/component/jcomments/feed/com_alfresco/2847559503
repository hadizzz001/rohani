			<description><![CDATA[Hemma:  This is a wonderful question.  Let us begin with how we would describe these three three faculties. 1.  Conscious mind is that aspect of the soul in which one constantly thinks The conscious mind thinks constantly and to varying degrees we are aware of our thoughts. 2. Sub-conscious mind is the faculty within the soul where the imprints or thought patterns that have been recorded from past actions and situations are stored. We are not always aware of the patterns that reside here, however, it is the memory and feelings that reside in the sub-consciousness that drive our current thinking.  3. The divine intellect is the faculty within the soul where we can discern what is going on in the mind. The intellect is the faculty of conscience. In using this faculty we can discern; right/wrong, good/bad, positive/negative. We can also decide if we want to accept the thought patterns that arise in the mind or if we want to create new thoughts that will change our patterns of thought. Most importantly, it is with the divine intellect that we are able to forge a connection with the Supreme Soul. When we experience this connection we rid ourselves of negative thoughts and  become full of the spiritual powers of purity, love, peace, truth and happiness. With spiritual knowledge we come to understand that the soul which includes the mind, imprints and intellect is the heart of our being. Yes, we have a physical organ which is called the heart but this is the pump which facilitates the movement of energy and oxygen throughout the body. The soul is eternal and that part of us which is eternal. It is where we create our awareness, feelings, vision, words and actions. It is through spiritual knowledge that we become aligned with out inner truth and through the study and practice of Raja Yoga that we begin to know ourselves and to become masters of our own minds.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Mamta: We understand it can sometimes be difficult to make choices in our lives.  But ultimately we are creators of our own destiny and the masters of our own lives.  Perhpas we could suggest that you write a list of the pro's and con's of the situation.  Then put away the list and sit quitely and reflect and feel from your heart which is the right thing to do.  Further if you do this in the awareness of being a soul a child of God, then your choices will bring benefit, to you and thoes around you. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Kavitaverma: To change our deep rooted sanskars we need determination, attention and patience.  Deep rooted sanskars have become natural to the soul and so automatically come into play when responding or reacting to situations, relationships or even our own thoughts.  We have to become a detached observer of ourselves so we can really 'see' what the root of the sanskara is and make the concious choice to change - to choose the ascending path, rather than slide down the decending path of habit. To cultivate pure awareness and to receive power - meditation and connection to the Supreme Source of all powers and qualities; God the Purifier - is a direct way to change sanskaras.  With this focused attention and direct relationship the soul becomes pure.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[One can realize one's own mistake only when he is in self conciousness and self realisation. If anyone is not in self conciousness and remain lost in worldly matter, then how one can realise about his mistake. So, for making the difference in wrong or right, one have to first realise himself. Then only one can take right decision every time.]]></description>
