			<description><![CDATA[Om ShantiDadiji I can not thank you enough for such life learning message which adds sixth sense to us and also opens up our third eye. This message lets us understand how valuable our soul is and how to keep it pure. Staying away from negativity makes our trip guiltless so we can travel light. I have been applying this  for a few weeks and I am able to accept people the way they are. As a matter of fact I am able to send positive energy with divine love. Om Shanti]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dileep:  Like any practice it takes attention and practice to develop our skills, and like any relationship we have to give time to it and gradually we get to know one another and become accustomed to their presence.  Getting to know God also takes time, the more time you spend in His company the more your intellect and heart open to His purity and unlimited qualities and you will find it easier to remember Him.  It is when we remember God the Supreme being that we receive power and the inheritance which is ours as Gods child.  Remembrance begets remembrance and so the more we remember God the more God remembers us!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I adore Dadi Janki and her wisdom. She has said the absolute truth which educates us on how one can remove negativity from day today life and be closer to their true self. We have to change our old mindset and get into the new mindset of being one with Brahma. I am practicing this and already seeing the results. It's amazing and beyond words. It just makes us feel very good about ourselves. And then we pass the same positive energy to others.]]></description>
