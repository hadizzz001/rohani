			<description><![CDATA[A very good question. Souls are eternal, as is the Supreme Soul. Just as the Supreme Soul, exists outside our world, so do some of the human souls. We call that place Paramdham, the Supreme Abode of souls. Once a soul comes down to Earth from Paramdham and enters a body, then, as you rightly said, the soul continues to take rebirth. The population of Earth is gradually increasingly as more and more souls come down to play a part in the big drama of life on Earth.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Focus and concentration are learned practices. We have to understand how the mind works and practice guiding the mind into a peaceful state. Then, we can practice concentrating, and not getting pulled into disruptive thoughts such as anger. One needs to study meditation and have a daily meditation practice to reverse the bad habits of the mind. The Brahma Kumaris offer meditation courses free of charge. You might want to try one.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[To forget the past, we need better memories to replace the old ones. Now is a new year - think about new ways you can improve your relationships and your personal habits. Think about small ways that you can make the world a better place. The soul loves this kind of thinking. When memories from the past reappear, think about new and positive ways that you can respond to those memories. Memories from the past may come for quite a while before you completely forget them. Don't let yourself get drawn into them. Watch them from a distrance and then 'turn the channel' of your thoughts.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[No one can be blamed when this happens. A good marriage requires harmony on many levels. Even one issue where there is not agreement can make the marriage too risky. It is best to be clear about what you want from a marriage partner, and move ahead in looking for a good match. Use your wisdom from the past to make a good choice.]]></description>
