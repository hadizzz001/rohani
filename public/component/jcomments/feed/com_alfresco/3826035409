			<description><![CDATA[It’s easy to be peaceful in a place that is filled with peace. Raja Yoga is about maintaining inner peace even when people are trying to disturb us. We may ‘know’ that we are peaceful souls but we don’t deeply believe it until we have consistently practiced the awareness of being a soul, an invisible, eternal being of light within the body. With practice, we can maintain this awareness in the face of disturbance, provided that inner peace is my top priority. This means I do not get involved in how another person behaves or what another person thinks of me. I just focus on my own inner peace. My only response to another person is a wave of peaceful vibrations. If I am unshakeable, then other people will lose interest in bothering me.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Meditation develops the awareness that we are souls -- eternal spiritual beings and children of God. In meditation we find inside the qualities of peace and love. We realise how important it is to do everything with peace and love. As souls we can connect with God, the Supreme Soul. God always loves us and helps us correct our weaknesses. This makes us more accepting of the weaknesses of others. We stop telling ourselves stories about what we need – instead we take strength from God. We stop telling ourselves stories about other people’s weaknesses – we see that they, like us, are trying to be better. We notice their virtues and offer kindness.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[My husband stayed at 2000 km away due to his posting. We have always tough fight for very lame issues but it was realized later on. He never felt sorry if I am upset for his word. It might not be hurse but I felt bad sometimes. I get angry and fight started. Sometimes it was very bad and he is not willing to talk with me but I eagerly waiting and again get irritated. So fights continued. Sometimes we fetch older issue in the time of fighting. But he never wants to talk about it. Is meditation will help me to control my anger and choosing of words in the time of fighting? Is it help me to control my emotion so that the samll issues never get overflowed ?]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[When there are challenges in our relationships, it is usually best to talk to the other person. There may be a good reason why this person has not paid the money back. With love and feelings of friendship, you can tell this person that you are wondering about this. Even if the issue does not get resolved and you decide to not speak with him any more, you at least gave it your best and you can let him go with good wishes. Then you are not left with any bitter feelings.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Too much thinking is wasteful of energy. Union with the higher power creates balance. Without progress there is no balance and creates stagnance. Conscience required to acknowledge sellf mistakes and to correct myself next time. Removal of addictions is the start.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Desires are very intense thoughts that appear to us on the screen of the mind. They have more energy than thoughts about school or work, and so they overpower our ability to focus on our responsibilities. The strong desires consume all our attention. There are two things we can do to minimize this. One, recognize that the desire is just a big surge of energy. If we entertain it by having thoughts about it, we make the energy stronger. We can instead stand back, watch it as a detached observer, and ask it to move out. This takes practice – it doesn’t happen right away. The second thing is to recognize how critically important your studies are at this point in your life. You can make whatever you want of your life, but you have to be able to stay focused on learning. The inner power that you develop by practicing this will serve you all throughout your life.]]></description>
