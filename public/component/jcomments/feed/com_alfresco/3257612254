			<description><![CDATA[If you have attachment to someone or somthing that person or thing will pull you in one direction or another and you will experience pain.  Expectations cause a lot of pain and frustration.  When you are attached you feel that someone or somthing is "mine"  but in reality no one or nothing belongs to you.  All are God's children, each has their own part in this play of life and you cannot control anyone or anything.  Focus on yourslef and if you really want to experience peace - remember your innate quality is peace - connect to that, and if you cannot, then connect to God who is the Ocean of Peace and Love, and you will experience benefit yourself and thoes around you will also benefit and this will anable you to experinece real love and be free attachemnt.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[The very heart of your writing shilst sounding agreeable at first, did not settle very well with me personally after some time. Someplace within the paragraphs you were able to make me a believer but just for a while. I nevertheless have a problem with your leaps in assumptions and one would do well to fill in those breaks. In the event you actually can accomplish that, I will definitely end up being fascinated. Its such as you learn my thoughts!

			<description><![CDATA[Choti:  Real love is given freely, without expectation, it is expectation which brings disapointment and sadness.  God (Baba) is the ocean of unconditional love and so when you connect to God in meditation you experience and receive the love that the soul is searching for.  The first step to experiencing love it to understand that you are a spiritual being of light and that love is innate within you.  Take some quite time to reflect and experience your wonderful self and love will emerge, you will then be able to share this spiritual love with others.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Anany bajaj:  In Dadi's message she askes "What does it mean to be a bestower of blessings".  Happiness is within the soul, we think we get it from outside, from situations, people or things, but actually it is a natural quality of the soul. When we use this happiness and share it with others, we experience even greater happiness.  So if the atmosphere of the family is negative, connect with the innate quality of happiness inside and share it with others this will bring benefit to your family, who are experiening negativity, it will increase your own happiness in the moment and it will strengthen your spiriutal practice, and give you the fruit of your good actions - happiness!  So whichever way you look at it, or experienceit - all gain.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Mala Nayar:  If you are not attached, there will be no expectations of how you will be treated in return for your love.  Love is free from expectations, love is patient and generous.  Attachement expcts a return - even if it is to be treated with equal love and respect - and when it doesn't happen, sorrow is experienced.   If someone is negative or nagging be patient and give love without expectaions. This spiritual practice will give you strength and since you are the one sharing that love, the quality of love in you will grow and you will be able to respond better in each situation you find yourself - in the meantime the other will also benefit as you give them the opportunity to see your example which may allow them to change their attitude - so both gain.]]></description>

Love is the basic essence of our living. Its very easy to say not get attached. I still don't feel one should stop loving in order to lead a happy life.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I agree ego and attachment are not good. Give love to everybody. Now my question is suppose you are doing best for everybody but there are some people who are very nagging type they try to take advantage of your sincerity instead of changing themselves to loving type. You lose your patience being harrased for again and again - in that case what to do?]]></description>

Ego   attachment is the greatest enemy   biggest hinderance in the path of progress....the bigest destroyer of the present day society. All the destructions   conflicts present, past   future are, were and will be the result of the two prime enemies of mankind. our prime focus should be,as you have suggested, to minimise the effect of these two negative element in our life.
