			<description><![CDATA[Indira: They say a problem shared is a problem halved.  We feel relief when we speak of something that is concerning us, with our friends.  Going into silence and reflecting deeply in a state of soul conciousness - allows us to see deeply the cause of our problems, connect with our inner qualities and fill ourselves with these quails which we can then use in our lives and relationships. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Yesha:  The only person who can control our thoughts is us.  People around us may continue to behave in many ways that we do not agree with but we can choose how to respond.  We are master of our own selves.  We cannot control others but with the practice of meditation we can learn to respond with peace, tolerance and love.  Which will bring benefit to ourselves and those around us, perhaps allowing them to see things differently.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Diren:  As with anything it takes practice and paying attention.  When you realize you are getting a lot of waste thoughts, at that moment make the change to think positively about your self or the situation.  This takes a bit of will power, and slowly slowly as you keep practicing you become stronger and your habit will start to change, you will become happier because your thinking has changed and you will have more confidence in your ability to change.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om shanti.  I am reading the message daily and it plays a role of antioxidant for me.  But as we speak about silence, I believe it, but my habit is often to share my problems or tensions with my close friends.  I also believe that if I omit out my inner tensions to my close friend I at least feel tension free which is a contrast to silence.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Shweta:  Dadi gives a very good method in this message.  If you want help with practicing going inside; into silence where the power comes to sort things out - we suggest you visit your local BK center where they teach meditation.  The daily practice of meditation will give you the power to control yourself.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[PRACTICE: To realize that it takes a second as Dadi Janki shares with us, is the real challenge: we tend to THINK too much, waiting too long for something that does not come but IS our inheritance. God has endowed us with this abillity from our beginning   for all eternity: connection (yoga) with God in silence.]]></description>

With Truth we get real Knowledge   Bliss....]]></description>
