			<description><![CDATA[Thank You Didi, for giving us the women the direction to know ourselves ... It is through the knowledge baba provided us we can realise our potential to become anything we want. When the world understands that we are actually souls who are bundles of positive energ, love, peace, happiness, knowledge and power there can not be any difference between men and women. This is very fundamental for establishing a peaceful society. I have realised this immense power of self and being close to the supreme soul through soul consciousness. One again thank you did I for this beautiful and relevant article]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[This is an awesome concept. I can say this because, being a woman, I have experienced the same striving for spirituality. Women have more spiritual power because they are blessed with the gift of faith and purity. Being a girl, I recommend that everyone believe in the power of spirituality because this is the utmost truth of our life and most of us have forgotten it. And this is the reason for all the problems in our own lives as well as for the world's major issues. We all have forgotten our original power. So please, be true to yourself and regain your original nature with Brahma Kumaris. Be happy and peaceful.]]></description>
