			<description><![CDATA[Armiti:  In order to hear your inner voice you need to stop the traffic of your many other thoughts, and go beyond the experience of the body.  With the practice of daily meditation, this will begin to happen.  One of the aims of meditation is to connect with the true, pure sound of the self.  When you are in the conciousness of the self, the soul, the quality of your thoughts will be based on your innate qualities of love, happiness, truth, peace and wisdom.  The more powerful this conciousness, the fewer thougths you will have, you will just experience being love, being blissful, being peaceful.  This can be said to be dead silence.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Jayasimha: There will always be opposition when we decide to do something different from everyone else.  Whilst keeping to our decided choice and discipline we should make it as easy as possible for others to accept.  So get up for Amrit Vela as quietly as possible so as not to disturb the rest of the family.  This early morning meditation is important and gives a lot of power to the soul and so it will bring you, and ultimately your family a lot of benefit because you will be empowered and more able to help your family through your spiritual stage.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Prachi:  Because we have spent a long time protecting our selves from percieved sources of attack it can be difficult to disern, our intellect has become habituated to thinking a certain way, and so our intuition may be clouded.  However with the practice of meditation and focusing on the presense of God, our way of thinking becomes gradually clearer.  Through this relationship trust is built - in God, and in ourselves. Our decisions become more and more influenced by God's and our own inate qualities of peace, love, happiness, and wisdom gradually emerge.]]></description>

I think I can't differentiate between intuitions & deep rooted fear. So I get confused many times while taking decisions. please guide me in this regard.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Shakthikadhirvel:  It is good that you are interested in these types of thoughts.  However reading about spiritual knowlege in itself is not enough to bring about transfromation.  Bringing these thoughts into your everyday life.  Practicing them, experimenting with them is what will bring the result.]]></description>
