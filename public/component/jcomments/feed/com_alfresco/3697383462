			<description><![CDATA[Thanku Dadi for your endless and tireless love and words that truly touch the soul.I may have stepped away from God but my heart can never truly leave that one. By having great examples, Angels my footsteps can be guided by those who have walked, lived and shared the highest truth. I am learning to acquire the power of patience which will bring love, self love and God into my mind and heart. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Meena.  Transforming your negative thoughts takes determination and practice, and a true desire to forgive and forget.  You have to let go of the past because this is a trap that keeps you from moving forward and being happy.  These thoughts are coming from inside and other people or outside situations cannot be blamed.  The good news is that this puts the solution in your hands. If you want help with this I suggest you go to the local Brahma Kumaris center and do a positive thinking course and this will help you get started. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Great message. I wish the wars all over the world and resentment and others guiding your life and pulling and controlling your life will not be there if you let go. When pointing fingers at others think of the 3 fingers and the thumb. The thumb goes to brain and if the pointing finger is withdrawn by letting go it is thumps up.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Good morning dadiji,I really agree with this - we never allow hurtful and painful things to go from our life, we cling to those negative thoughts as if they are the part and parcel of our daily routine.  It is a common experience that we accept negative things more rapidly but our mind is not unable to cultivate positive things rapidly.  So dadiji its true if we keep on clinging to negative things our soul becomes very weak and we become  a victim of ourselves only.It is  as though we become enslaved by our own deficiency. Dadiji your message acts like a rubbing stone to free our inside.]]></description>

Actually the bad situation is there for a small fraction of time, but we keep on clinging to i. Instead, if we make ourselves free from the situations we can be close to God, we just have to go on and go on. om Shanti.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[It is such a wonderful message from Dadi. Many a times, it's the mental replay of the situations that makes them more bitter and the hurt lingers on... So, when the mind is engaged in other activities, those bitter situations fade away into the background. When one is inactive, the mind goes back and fetches those bitter situations and brings them to the fore and the hurt begins all over again...So, we really need to let go!]]></description>
