			<description><![CDATA[You have a very elevated goal in life and many people will benefit from your service. While many of Sister Shivani’s public talks are recorded, not every one is recorded. Keep looking at the awakening/in website. If this talk has been recorded, it will be posted.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[If this program helps you stay centered and stable, then definitely make time to watch it every day. In addition, excellent programming available on pmtv.in/. You can find courses by Sister Shivani, classes by senior BK teachers, music and more. Make time for yourself in both the morning and the evening to watch a show on a spiritual topic. This will help stabilize your mind and also help you feel lighter and freer when confronted with bodily ailments.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Negative thoughts are a usual part of consciousness. They come because we have the habit of negative thinking. The more negative thoughts we have about a person or situation, the more likely those thoughts are to come again and again, without our wanting them. In Raja Yoga, we practice having peaceful, purposeful and positive thoughts. We fill the memory bank with this type of thought. There isn’t so much “space” for negative thoughts and so they come less frequently. And when a negative thought comes, we recognize it as such and do not allow it to repeat over and over. Over time, the incidence of negative thoughts can be greatly reduced.]]></description>
