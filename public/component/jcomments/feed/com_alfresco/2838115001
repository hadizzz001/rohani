			<description><![CDATA[Puspita Panda:  Love and peace are origional qualities in the soul.   We sometimes do not experience these because we have become disconneced with our true selves. Meditation helps us to access these qualities within oursleves.  Through Rajyoga meditation we also learn how to reestablish a direct connection with God who is the consistant source of all qualities including love, peace, happiness, truth and wisdom.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Shivani Sharma:  "Love for myself" -  Who are you?  Are you a body or a living being of light, conscient energy - a soul.  It is important to get to know your true self, spend time with your self and deeply love yourself before you can love and know others.  You are a soul who inhabits your body.  It is important to take care of your physical body since it is your responsibility, and you experience your life through your body. Your experience will generally be happier if you keep your body healthy, however keeping you, the soul, lovefilled, healthy, and happy is the key.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[   Santoch Kag: Peace and Happiness are the original qualities of the soul, in order to develop these we have to get to know, and spend time with, our true selves. Many, many of us seek peace and happiness from external things, but external things are transitory, and as our expectations are inevitably unfulfilled, sorrow and peacelessness are quick in coming. In order to experience lasting peace and happiness it is necessary to spend to inside and explore our internal treasures. A good way to do this is through meditation. If you are interested in Raj Yoga meditation you can find a center near you on this site of if you live in India, from brahmakumaris.org. PrapbuBandia: It is the natural capacity of the mind to think. The key is to be able to create positive and powerful thoughts that bring benefit to yourself and others. Thoughts based on the qualities of peace, and that are filled with spiritual love, bring clarity and meaning to our lives. Waste and negative thoughts run fast, meditation will help to develop the strength to direct our minds in the way that we want. Going to a center to learn mediation from a teacher will help you in this endeavor. Watching TV programs can be helpful and inspirational, but to make effort to learn and to put into practice a method is a valuable tool that you can learn and then put into practice in your daily life.]]></description>
