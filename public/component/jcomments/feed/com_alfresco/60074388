			<description><![CDATA[Jaya: If it has happened it was in the drama of life to happen and yessometimes we know or feel what is going to happen.  It could be foresight;the mind touching on something that is in the future. And yes thoughts as acause do definitely create effect.  Perhaps you have already done a lot ofwork in this area that has resulted in intuition.  The responsibility thenis to keep the thoughts pure, elevated and filled with good wishes for theself, others and the world.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Kavita:  It is good that you have completed your meditation course and that it has been helpful in controlling your thoughts.  With daily practice your mind will become more peaceful and it will give you a chance to experience yourself as a being of light and peace.  With this practice you will then be able to connect to God more easily, as God (Baba) is also an incorporeal being of light.  The more subtle and light you become the more you will be able to 'tune' into the same 'wavelength' as God' and be able to access all that God is . .  the Ocean of Love, the Ocean of Happiness, and full of all powers.etc .  Spending time in this way you will gradually deepen your experience and relationship with God and be able to bring Godly qualities into your daily life. Like anything meditation takes practice and determination, but if you keep with it you will be successful and not get so affected by daily ups and downs of life.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Sanjeev: From our knowledge we understand that God is a separate being from us - we are a soul and God is the Supreme Soul.  He therefore doesn't come into us.  We can however link to God and draw strength from God through meditation, specifically Raj Yoga meditation.  If you would like to find out more about this you can visit one of our centers and take a course in this meditation.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Good morning dadiji.Today we are celebrating 63 years of independence (in India). I just want to ask dadiji are we really independent? From birth as a girl, we have to do whatever our elders say, then youth comes and we have our husband and in-laws; it is as if we are an animal and have to obey whatever they say.  In this process we forget who we are and what my duty is towards myself.  Up until now I lived for everyone else, but everything was in vein. My previous belief system was that if he or she was happy then I would be happy.  But now I  think the reverse is true so thanks dadiji, thanks to myself for me.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Pardeep Sharma:  This is a big question and one answer is that it is the souls destiny to come into the cycle of the drama of life and to play its part.  The tiny soul has its whole part recorded in it and the aim of its life is to express that part.  To come into relationship with other souls, with God, with matter, and to know itself.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[The first stage of meditation is watching our thoughts. You can start with it now. Wake up in the morning and just watch your thoughts... don't try to stop them...just watch that noise. You can practice doing this whenever you get time. Because before doing this we aren't even aware whats going on in our mind.  You can also go the nearest center to learn it further.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Its very very essential to accumulate inner strength.  When one faces a day of adverse conditions it requires a constant practice of rajyoga. I myself have experienced whenever i am in deep grief, when everything seems so topsy-turvy i come to the shade of God and i feel really good. So meditation really works. But the moment we are detached from God; illusion and vices catch hold of us.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Good morning dadiji. You are absolutely right. Cultivation of inner strength is much required these day to overcome adverse situations. It gives us strength of mind and the courage. Actually the thing is that we all have some sort of inner hidden energy with us but until we face situations we cannot exercise that accumulated strength of ours. Reading your message in the morning gives a cooling and soothing effect to the mind and the mind is happy and in a wonderful mood, thus we can do absolutely anything - nothing is impossible. thanking you dadiji for the wonderful work you are doing.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Maria:  Meditation is a step by step process which is more easily taught by going to a center near you and taking classes with others or individually.  The Brahma Kumaris have centers in many countries around the world.  If you go to 'Where are you' and then click on center near you, You should be able to find something.  If you live in India then go to the brahmakumaris.org website for their addresses]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Rajyoga meditation gives me so many benefits. I especially feel God's hand on me at every moment.  Only God gives us unconditional love and this way we can change our life as we are the children, and we can also do this to make the world heaven. I feel so happy to contribute some good wishes minutes for  the 'good wishes bank' program.  It is amazing to severe the world with out any expectation from the BKs.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Good morning Dadiji, I read your message. I do agree with you on this topic, but the problem is that whenever we read the message we feel very good but afterward when a real situation comes we are not able to face the situation, because a constant practice of accumulation of inner strength is required to face those adverse situations.  But by the time we repent the incident has already taken place so not to repeat the mistakes time and again we do have to practice regular meditation. Dadiji thank you for the wonderful message.om shanti.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I totally agree with this. I do meditation all the time even when I have a lot of work. Meditation is not only when you sit alone and close your eyes, and remember the God. Meditation is a life style, its self realization or you can say when you recognize yourself and others.  If you understand we are souls, every one is a soul you can communicate easily, interact easily.  Meditation brings results.]]></description>
