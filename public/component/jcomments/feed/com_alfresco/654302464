			<description><![CDATA[purbi:  You the soul are a mind, intelect and sanskara's (impressions on the soul created by your actions,which form your personality).  When you practice Raj Yoga meditation and become introverted, just by watching your thoughts and seeing what sort of thoughts you have you will begin to understand who and what sort of soul you are.  Then if you want to make changes to the types of thoughts you have, Raj Yoga meditation will help you to do this.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[When we are in silence we can listen to our thoughts and use the mind in a worthwhile way. Sending good wishes and pure feelings of love to the world. In silence we can connect with God and share his light and love.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I havebeen to Mt. Abu 18 years before & visited BK's HQ as well & found that I was in heaven since the white dress code of everyone gave a glimpse of a heaven. Since than whenever I was at Mt. Abu I visited HQ & Peace park regularly. Since last 1 year regularly watching talk show of BK Shivani & imbibed her teaching in my thoughts & find new way of thinking, moreover I can change the thought process at my own & on immediate basis, second positive thinking can do wonders & I sincerely believe that 'When I change,the world changes'.I keep print of Dadi Janki's messages & read them before sleep.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[The actual meaning of silence is the silence of mind and not of mouth. We may remain calm and talk very less but still we cant attain the stage of actual silence because there is continuous conversation in our mind. When we start connecting to supreme soul the quality of this conversation changes from negative to positive. Silence means when the conversation in our mind does not disturb us and the environment and people around us. Om shanti]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om Shanti'Silence is golden' is a phrase often used, yet, many times when we have silence, we tend to think that something is wrong. How many of us switch on the radio or television as soon as we awaken or return home from work? I used to be like that; now I have begun to appreciate the sound of silence to the extent that my husband would ask me if anything is wrong.]]></description>
