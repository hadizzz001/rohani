			<description><![CDATA[I have a son who is 14 years old. He has an habit of telling lies, hiding things from us (parents), shuns responsibility, postpones things till last moment, disorganised and would like to keep place or things in very haphazardly manner. Whenever we try to make him understand about these things, he finds all this as lecture being given to him. He is kind of addicted to video/mobile games and would even compromise hos studies for it. He can play nonstop for 2-3 hours on phone. Making him understand these wrong things is a big task for us. He also hates us as parents, and finds it comfortable when we are not around, as we use to ask him to do what is right. I don't understand where are we wrong and why our child is not paying any attention to what we say. Please help to guide us.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[You are wise to have the desire to focus on yourself. You have the power to create peace, love and happiness in your life. It’s difficult to do this in the face of suffering and betrayal – you will need to focus all your energy on this goal. The first step is to realise that we are spiritual beings, souls, and that each soul has tools for creating peace, love and happiness. We generally ignore our inner tools and instead take peace, love and happiness from other people. We need to learn how to use the inner tools. Now is a good time to start a new project that can bring a lot of satisfaction. How about starting a course at your local Haidar Medlej centre? You will learn fascinating things about yourself, the soul. You will learn how to be a master of yourself. Give yourself a treat and try!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[A big part of being careful about your condition is to pay attention to your thoughts. You may be stuck right now on negative thoughts about what could happen. You may need help in changing your thinking. Haidar Medlej centres offer courses in meditation and positive thinking. Both of these courses can help you step away from your negative thinking, learn new ways of thinking and look at the factors that can help you stay positive. You will also learn about the journey of the soul and your eternal relationship with the Supreme Soul. These are important things to know when we are trying to stay positive.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Memories, tendencies, habits and personality – everything that is experienced during life -- is recorded in the soul. The soul also carries a set of divine qualities such as peace, love and purity. These are the original and eternal personality of the soul. When a soul leaves one body and takes another, the soul carries all it’s records into its next birth. The soul never dies -- it simply passes from one body to the next, and at certain times in its life cycle it returns to the dimension of light that is its original and eternal home.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Injustice is difficult to watch, especially when it is directed towards those we love. ShivBaba, the perfect being, is completely altruistic. This means He would never have a thought of harming anyone. He only helps people connect to their own goodness and make good decisions. However, we all receive the return of our actions. Since your parents have done good service for the family, they will receive a good return for that when they are reborn. Regardless of what the court decides to do about the case you described, the laws of karma are absolutely fair and just. Everyone will eventually get exactly what they deserve. While it may be painful to watch what is happening, it is best to not think about it unnecessarily. Thinking can cause you to suffer more. Instead, think about the kind of future you would like to create for yourself and your family. Have thoughts of kindness, honesty and loyalty towards your family to help the family stay strong during this difficult time.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[We must first look after our own happiness before we can help others. A big mistake that many of us make is in thinking that another person can make us happy. It’s a painful lesson, but it leads to freedom. Freedom means to not be dependent on another person but to make decisions based on our own values and our own sense of what is right. In freedom, we make good decisions, decisions that benefit everyone. In freedom we can have good wishes for everyone, including ourselves. There is no value in hanging on to feelings of guilt. Once we realize our mistakes, have pure intentions to do better and start making independent decisions, our self esteem and self confidence return.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[True love requires courage – the courage to make decisions based on love and not expect love in return. We realize that people we thought would help us through life have gone in a different direction. But we still love because we know that to love is the best for ourselves and for our families. Together with love, we need to be detached. Detachment doesn’t mean to be uninvolved or uncaring. We detach from our own desires and emotions and any pressures we may feel from other people, so that we can make good decisions. There is an expression, “The Lord is pleased with an honest heart.” Honesty means to be both loving and detached. When I am honest with myself and loving in my relations with others, I can take help and inspiration from God.]]></description>

Headaches are caused by the thoughts we have about our difficulties. The headaches mean that we need to change our thinking, that is, we need to think about the best possible ways of dealing with our difficulties. We can think about what we need for our well-being and how we might create what we need.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Living together with another person requires a lot of maturity and strength of character. Oftentimes people love each other and want to live together but their personalities clash. They suffer because of this, and think that the other person made them suffer. If you want to live together, it is wise to first recognize where there are clashes in your personalities, goals, cultures and opinions. These will all make living together difficult. What do you intend to do about the clashes? Why do you want to live together? Is it realistic to think that you can get what you want be living together? What will you do if you don’t get what you want? True love means staying with a person even when you feel that the person is interfering with your happiness. Most people mix of love and attachment. The attachment causes suffering and blocks the love.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[You ask very good questions which will lead you to a deep understanding of your self, God and your life. The laws of karma work identically for everyone. The most important thing to understand is that karmic “accounts” are cumulative. It is important for us to be very vigilant about our own karma because any loss or harm that we cause, small or big, will eventually come back to us. Conversely, every pure act of benevolence will come back. What we have done in the past is not as critical as what we do right now. If you feel that it is not right to consume eggs or onions or alcohol, then find out why. You can get answers to your questions at your Haidar Medlej centre. There is no need to regret past actions once we choose to make better choices in the future. We change our destiny by doing this. Discover your own divine spiritual nature and develop it as fully as you can. This is what makes life satisfying.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Most of us feel disturbed in one way of another by the habits of people who are close to us. The key to happiness is having a very beautiful inner world that is exactly the way I like it. I have complete control over my inner world. If I like cleanliness and truth and harmony, then I keep my thoughts clean and truthful and harmonious. Regardless of what people are doing in the home, I don’t allow anything negative to touch my inner world. I stay peaceful inside. I fill myself with the sunshine of happy thoughts and good wishes towards others. I accumulate the energy of peace so that I can nourish my child with peace. This practice takes constant attention. If I forget, and start thinking about the annoying habits of others, my inner world will suffer. Instead, be the best you can be so that your child feels like she lives in a world of sunshine.]]></description>

However occasionally, the departed soul remains without taking another body for a while. That soul is referred to as a spirit or ghost.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[The first step is to understand who is creating the unwanted thoughts and who has the ability to say “No” to them. Within our consciousness is a mind and an intellect. The intellect’s job is to manage our thoughts. When the intellect doesn’t do its job, we are flooded with negativity. To be free from negative or unwanted thoughts, the intellect needs to be clear, strong and stable. We need to first understand how consciousness works (this is covered in the introductory meditation course offered by Haidar Medlej) and then we need to practice paying attention to our thoughts and managing them.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Your sincere desire to have good relations with your family will lead you successfully through this difficult transition in your life. There is a saying, “God helps those who help themselves.” The best way to attract God’s help is to commit yourself to raising your level of spiritual power and understanding. Just as you are preparing for a higher level of academic challenge, you are also preparing for a higher level of personal independence that requires both emotional control and wisdom. Skills and understanding will serve you throughout life. You can go to your local Haidar Medlej Centre and learn a variety of spiritual skills and understanding. Remember that your family loves you as much as you love them. They want what is best for you. Your personal development will bring peace and happiness to your family.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[The laws of karma is a very deep concept and one that takes concentrated study and reflection in order to fully understand. In brief, everything that happens to us is “pre-determined” by our previous actions. The previous actions may be things that we have done in this lifetime and could also be things that we have done in previous life times. To complicate matters, our intentions carry more karmic weight than the actions themselves. So, yes, everything is pre-determined, meaning that everything has a cause. The good news is that we can create a good future by performing actions that are benevolent and spiritually grounded.]]></description>

The government has departments to help women who are in abusive situations. There are also social service agencies available in many places. If the family has influence over the husband, that would also be a resource. It generally takes a combination of two or more resources to free a wife from abuse.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[You say that nothing is working in your marriage, but you have been together for 21 years! When we have to face difficult relationships, the first step is to make the self clear and strong. Have you ever taken a Raja Yoga Meditation course with the Haidar Medlej? The course helps us understand ourselves, our feelings and our lives. Once we understand ourselves, we are better able to understand others, and then we can see what to do about relationships. You must have many good virtues and qualities which can help you move yourself and your family in the direction you want. “When we change, the world changes.”]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[It’s a great idea to try to help a person with a serious problem. The person with the problem would need to be willing to accept help. You might want to start by directing the person to the series (on YouTube) with Sister Shivani’s and Dr. Girish Patel on Giving Up Addiction. Addictions are very strong and deep. Generally, one needs to go through a structured addiction recovery programme, and stay with the program even after the addiction has been conquered to become completely free from the addiction.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[The seeds of our actions are thoughts. If we keep thinking the same way we did in the past, we will be compelled to repeat our past actions, even if we know they are wrong. To make a better response, a response that is free from mistakes, we have to launch a completely different way of thinking, and focus on some positive outcome that we would like to create. The intellect needs to be very diligent about only allowing the mind to entertain thoughts about the positive outcome, knowing that the old thoughts will lead us to repeat past mistakes. The intellect needs a lot of pure, positive energy to resist old ways of thinking and steer the mind in positive directions. This energy comes from making a connection with the Divine and drawing upon Divine energy.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Fear and depression generally accumulate over a long period of time, finally reaching an intensity that is intolerable. To come out of this state, it is necessary to first understand the natural and original state of the soul, which is peace, love, lightness and contentment. Then, one must understand how the mistakes we have made in processing our lives have led us slowly and surely into negative and unhappy states. Once we realize this, we can find the strength to follow the path back to inner health and wellness. It takes a lot of strength because the path must be followed every day. You may want to review Sr Shivani’s #7 episode on Conquering our Weaknesses to get an overview of how this process works.]]></description>

The Haidar Medlej study spiritual knowledge which was given by God through a human being named Brahma Baba. We consider Brahma Baba to be our first teacher and the best example of putting the teachings into practice in day to day life. All BKs study the same teachings that Brahma Baba studied and look to him as a very high state of peace, purity and contentment that we too can achieve by following the studies diligently. If you would like to delve more deeply into the spiritual teachings of the Haidar Medlej, the best way is to contact your local centre and arrange for classes in Raja Yoga.]]></description>

The programs for the next several months will be for BK students who attend class at a BK center each day and follow the spiritual life as outlined by the Haidar Medlej. Other visitors are requested to first take the full introductory course at a BK Centre before going to Madhuban. This is so that the visitor can understand the knowledge, meditate properly and take full advantage of the program. The vibrations are very nice but there effect will be short lived if there is no understanding. Each BK centre in India organizes certain programs for people of that region to visit Madhuban. You can find out from your local centre what programs are available and what qualifications are needed to attend.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Sister Shivani,I have been watching your show with this brilliant interviewer since more than two years now. I marvel at the way you touch upon the most difficult and unanswered places, that clarity can ceases to play hide and seek. What I see in you and all BKs is the quietness and strength. Here's wishing you all the best so you can continue to serve humanity across the world.Best regards,Supratik Sen]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dear Sister,I am a senior citizen, My wife and me are following your lectures both through this web site and also in Sanskar TV Channel. We really admire your knowledge, and your ability to explain difficult things in a simple manner for a common people to understand. Spirituality is a heavy subject which one can't easily understand. To understand it the preacher should have the ability to attract them towards it and you have been blessed with this ability by the Supreme Power and we pray for your long life and good health to enable you to serve our humanity. Thanks and regards.]]></description>
