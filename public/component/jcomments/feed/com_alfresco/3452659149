			<description><![CDATA[Its really very true that we must transform ourselves with pure thoughts and good wishes for others,because its very much essential for making a better world to live in since if our pure thoughts are not reflected outside and if we are not well wishers of others we create a world full of sorrows and if our surrounding is not a happy place how can we expect to live happily ever after in this very unhappy world.So one needs to be transformed for one's own happiness only,I think this explanation will help today's self-centered man to understand very easily as I have highlighted their own interest]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dadi, Purity of thoughts makes me pure. I didn't know that by sending good wishes to others makes me feel good and during the process this will also spread love and happiness in the society. This technique have cured all my tension and anxiety. I no longer complain about others behavior, on the contrary i send them good wishes. As Dadi said Koi acha hai ti bohut acha aur bura hai to acha ho jayega.Thank you]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[What a great thought! I love the word 'erase'. This is a strong word which made me think here that we have been given an opportunity to take the eraser and clean up or delete or erase the past just as we erase when we make a mistake while writing.This also made me think of a beautiful thought that was taught by sister Reva in our Monday class- When our body dies and we get into another body. We do not remember the past from the previous birth. The same way we must erase bad memories and only remember the knowledge of Soul and God gained through the BKSWU.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Respected B.K.Janaki JI. Thanks for guiding about transformation. If everyday we decide that we have to eliminate 1 negative quality from outside, then surely we can be a good human being and improve our character.I have started practicing good wishes for people around me and try to keep 10-15 min for myself each morning and evening.Om Shanti.RegardsAnjali ( MBA)Vizag, India]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dear Dadiji, I totally agree with you .I have experimented with this my self and I saw that when I forget my past, just like a seen of drama, and was in the consciousness of just a actor then i was easily able to detached my self from the past. And go through the experience loving the whole world . I feel all are ok . It gives me power to accept .Then I feel God is transforming me in an incognito way because i love his beloved children.]]></description>
