			<description><![CDATA[sur pars: Step back from the situation to get a wider perspective.  There are many reasons why we like and dislike things - much of it is personal habit.  If we try and take the wider view, we are more easily able to see things as a whole. Not everyone sees things the same way we do, our way is not necessarily the only way.  Understanding ourselves to be souls, concient beings of energy, imperishable actors playing our parts on the world stage can give us a different perspective which can change our response to things.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om shanti. A year ago i took the 5 day coure at one of the BK center in India, after that I did not get chance to listen to the nice thoughts about God. One day i asked God (Shiv Baba) to show me a way to learn about him more. The next day i got email from peace village and found this website. I visited Peace village couple of years ago. Thank you shiv baba. I am learning new things every day from your thoughts.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Shankhanil:  God is the Supreme Soul an incaporeal being of light, the Ocean of love, Peace, Purity, Truth and Happiness. God is a seperate being from us - not within us or omipresent. God is our spiritual Parent and we are His/Her children. God is ever pure and therefore could not be involved in any of the negativity or bad works that we as human beings get up to.  God is the only soul who is beyond birth and rebirth and therefore remains uninfluneced by matter.  It is because God is ever pure that we call out to 'Him' to purify us and it is by remembering God and connecting to Gods power of purity that our souls can be purified getting rid of the negativitgy we have accumulated through wrong actions.  We are responsible for our actions and cannot be forced to be dishonest.  By connecting to God through meditation we can receive the power to do what is right and the fruit of thoes actions will be accordingly.  If you are interested in learning this meditation Brahma Kumaris centers around the world offer them and you can find your local center by going looking on this site if you live outside India or brahmakumaris.org if you live in India.]]></description>
