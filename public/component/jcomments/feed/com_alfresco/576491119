As our mind becomes more silent and free from waste or negative thoughts our wisdom grows and there will be success.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I have discovered that the seed of the past and future is "NOW". The only time that exist is "NOW" or "The Present", so while we exist at the "Now", we should make full use of "NOW" very positively. The past is gone while the future is ever coming but "NOW" is here. If u keep thinking of the past or future, you will remain "NO~WHERE" But to think of the present is to be "NOW~HERE" from a "NO~WHERE". To be at the present is to keep your mind and thought on what is happening now while to keep your mind on that which is not happening is to be at the past or future.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dadiji, I accurately understood the meaning with practical example of spiritual knowledge. Eventually, when Time brought me and made me in-front of &ldquo;Supreme Soul&rdquo; (with BK&rsquo;s hand)&ndash; I was about to lose my job from this lifetime drama. Believe me, by this strength, every step of Spiritual Knowledge is being tested with &ldquo;check   change&rdquo; of my present thoughts and actions! I think, it&rsquo;s is the script of God drama for me to understand the every drop of knowledge in this life. So peaceful and calmness I am experiencing, even though seeing a volatile physical status of this life. Om Shanti !]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Reeine Naidoo:  Meditaion like anything else needs practice.  Regular exersise builds strengh and power.  Everyone who has the capacity to think and feel, can meditate.  Start with determinatin and a desire to do it. Begin with short focused sessions and then extend the time, you will get results.  There are many BK centers where you can go and learn. Enjoy!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dear Dadi Janki, It is absolutely correct, we do feel that we waste too much of time and energy thinking about the past, that results in eroding the present and future as well. Since the time I have started attending the BK meditation classes and practicing to follow your preaches, I feel that my peace of mind has increased and I am able to concentrate on my work better. Thank you so much once again, Dadi for your wonderful teachings. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om shanti dadiji. Nobody knows what will happen in the future and it is worthless to worry over past. So when we spend so much of energy on these waste thoughts we become unable to see the oppertunities, blessings and happiness in the present moment. So human beings suffer a lot. Happiness is an art. Happiness is not the desination but it is a journey.]]></description>

Using the mind and intellect in a worthwhile way creates better relationships with ourselves and others. Feeling gratitude for the many blessings we are bestowed upon by Baba (God) is a great start to the day.]]></description>
