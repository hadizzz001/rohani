			<description><![CDATA[Charles:  Read againthe message from Dadi, and when you sit in meditation, practice experiencingwhat is said, especially the last two paragraphs.  Meditation is experienced through thought andfeelings, so when thinking these thoughts create the feelings that go withthem, this will create a shift in your consciousness, even if it is onlyslightly to begin with, this practice will help and when your consciousnesschanges your thoughts will change and so will your dreams and your actions.  In your daily practical life create good andpositive thoughts that lead to good actions this again will feed into your consciousness. Create the awareness that you have achoice of what to think and what actions to take.  Every step you take creates your life.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Not until yesterday, did I come across this website, I was pondering through others which to me was just passing time and throwing my thoughts and energy around a waste time. Then today this website again touched my fingers and brought in contact with this message and the coolness,a smile and value it gave me inside. I am presently studying childcare (knowledge on children) and vow each child I come across is so unique so individual so pulling.. like Dadi your message is so pure and so touching that I want to tell the world what simple being and pure thinking, how it refreshes the soul.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I am retired Principal Scientist cum Professor. I have been into alternative therapies for more than two decades as well. I have found profound health benefits in my patients when they are peaceful at mind through assurance and manipulation of thoughts through counseling and at the same time explained scientific basis of healthy mind and body.I have great respect and regard for Dadi Janki since 15th August, 1982 when I met her for the first time while she was addressing a congregation in United Nations Building New York City as a Director Overseas for the organisations. My hats off to her.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Thank you. I am a registered nurse who deeply loves all; my residents, the folks with whom I work and my friends. I have lost my balance though. this simple meditation takes me to the beautiful place we all share and though it is difficult to take the time to listen, the simple and short time I set aside to meditate has a daylong effect. I hope to become more involved with this site as it is easy to use and I illiterate in the way of websites, Bless all, Sally]]></description>
