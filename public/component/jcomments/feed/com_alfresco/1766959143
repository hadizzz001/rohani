			<description><![CDATA[Sarita Singh: Happiness is an inate quality of the soul, it can be accessed by re-learning and putting it into practice.  Spending more reflective time to get to know yourself and God better is a good way to be happy, positive, and satisfied.  It is interesting that many people feel that in order to be happy they have to have their diesires fulfilled but actually giving and shareing is a wonderful way to experience happiness.  Also, it is for each person to, reflect on and understand their goal in life, and to do this you need to understand who you are and what your real aims are.  Most people want peace, love, happiness and truth in their lives -  Meditation is a way to reaccess these qualities.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Sunita:  Jealousy is indeed an emotion that robs us and others of happiness. It is a very destructive emotion that causes nothing but sorrow.  Each ones fortune is our own and no one can take that away from us.  The only one who can do that is ourselves.  By continuing to keep our aims and working towards our goals we will be successful and we will get the return of that effort - and if the aims and goals are for good then we will receive good and there will be happiness.  Giving is also a sure way of receiving happiness.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Sharda:  Yes the outside world is very negative and it is easy to let this negativity inside to such an extent that we find it hard to be positive.  But the positive qualities of love, happiness, truth, and purity are within the soul and we have to spend some time with ourselves to realize and access them.  This can be dificult to begin with because we have become so influenced by what surrounds us.  You may want to go to your nearest BK center and take some courses on positive thinking and meditation to help you.  It helps sometimes to do this with others and the support of a teacher. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Narinder:  Keep reading these messages and reflect on them.  It may take some time to experience the peace and happiness you have inside, we have become weak by allowing the outside influences effect us and it has become our habit to do this. But if you continue to reflect on powerful spiritual knowledge, in time you will connect with your true peaceful self (like any relationship you have to put in the time).  When sadness comes, recognize that you have created it and you can change, by focusing on things that bring happiness naturally to the soul - things connected to truth and are meaningful to you.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[The words of guidance that enrich the soul obviously are the words that say we are one, that we are all part of the same family connected by one supreme father' god who guides and protects and surely this is one who sees and knows as a companion of god, someone we can all learn from.]]></description>
