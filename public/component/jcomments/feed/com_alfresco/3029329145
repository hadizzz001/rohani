			<description><![CDATA[It is very encouraging to hear the words of wisdom. I am inspired and grateful. It is my understanding that when a soul takes birth; he has come from heaven and is still in the company of God and His angels. With the passage of time, he keeps moving away from God into the dustful glory( that is ephemeral) of this mortal world. The only way to Regain the Paradise Lost is to keep the company of Saints and Meditate. Thank You.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Its not in our hands to see God but only God. God is seen only through divine vision and the possibility to see Him depends on you. It takes deep love and high level of purity to see God. The first step in seeing God is seeing yourself through the topic "WHO AM I?" No physical eyes can see God.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Swapna Banerjee:  Once the soul is in the body, it cannot go anywhere - if it does then the body will die.  If you are speaking of meditation; when you become detached in meditation it is the conciousness that detaches, and travels; just as when you think back in time, your concousness goes back and remembers, but the soul doesn't travel back in time.  So it is your conciousness that travels not the soul.  Once the body dies the soul can travel and then it will take another body, and begin its next birth.  In terms of feeling a reletive, whether they are still alive or have left the body, you are remembering the essencse of that one and so invoke their presense, but again it is usually not the actual soul that comes it is just the essense, the impression of them that you experience because you are remembering them.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Purbi:  Om shnti.  God is the Supreme Soul, the Mother and Father of all souls.  God is incaporeal, the Living Supreme Being of Light.  God's name is Shive, the Seed, the Benfacor and the Eternal point of light.  If you who are a soul also, become soul concious, in this awareness you can come to know God.  If you want to know more, then going to a BK center will give you a deeper insight and good methods to practice.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dadi, is eternally right. Always right is Dadi. Saying the little words "thank you" with deep feelings of appreciations means a lot. To appreciate a soul with some little gift with thank you encourages that soul to do even greater. So Dadi, we say "thank you" we appreciate you for your motherly love. All the BK'S and others are grateful to you, Dadi.]]></description>
