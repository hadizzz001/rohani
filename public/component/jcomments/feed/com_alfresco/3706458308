			<description><![CDATA[A slogan of the Brahma Kumaris is “Don’t give sorrow; don’t take sorrow.” We all know it is wrong to give sorrow to another living being. But we often ignore our spiritual responsibility to not take sorrow from the words or actions of others. We each have to make our own decisions based on what we feel is best. If we do what someone else wants, we will not respect ourselves and we will then blame the other person for our feeling low. Through Raja Yoga we learn to understand our own needs and desires, follow our own values and principles, and take responsibility for our own happiness. This is a lot to take on, and fortunately the Supreme Soul helps because He wants us to be free, responsible and happy.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Thinking, remembering, recognizing, understanding are all functions of the soul, the inner being of light. However, the soul uses the brain to store and process information. If parts of the brain are missing or damaged, then the soul will have difficulty in even the simple tasks of daily life. Your doctor would be the best one to help you understand what is happening in your brain. However, you can focus on developing the qualities of the soul – peace, love, purity, bliss. This is done through meditation. You can either visit a Brahma Kumaris centre or you can listen to meditation commentaries online from a Brahma Kumaris website. The more you nourish the soul, the better you will be able to cope with the limite capacities of the brain.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[We want to help the people we love and it is difficult when they do not accept our help. However, no one can change unless he or she wants to change and sees a good reason to change. As you take good care of yourself and make good decisions for the well-being of the family, you will be a good role model for your children. You can teach your children how to communicate clearly, setting a good example by responding warmly to their attempts at good communication. If your husband is not ready to speak with you directly, he can learn by watching. You can still speak to him, even if he chooses not to respond. Keep a positive attitude so that others can learn from you. As the harmony in the home increases, your husband may feel comfortable enough to speak. Even if he doesn’t, other family members will appreciate your positive energy.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Raja yoga meditation is a process of looking within and seeing the qualities, the light and the beauty of the soul. From that place of inner radiance, we connect with our supremely loving Spiritual Father. Raja yoga meditation helps us realize that we are souls and the bodies are our vehicles. The bodies are extremely important because through them we express the beauty and truth of the soul. Raja yoga meditation helps us appreciate the body without trying to change it, and use it in ways that bring peace and joy to the self and the world]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[It is wonderful that you are trying to control the mind, but remember to guide it with love and patience. I would suggest that you and your son accept whatever emotions you are having with love. Understand that we have been different genders in different births, so don’t worry if you have attachment to being a particular gender. Meditation and the practice of enjoying being a soul and being soul conscious helps one stabilize in one’s core qualities. As all your beautiful core qualities are naturally in the soul, they do not change with a preference to a gender or a change of gender. So, perhaps do not worry about this gender issue so much, but do what is comfortable for you and see a therapist if you are conflicted about it. But, mostly, enjoy your naturally beautiful qualities as a soul, and be light about your gender preference. Meditate every day … be light, and know that you are God’s beloved child.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Helping a child develop healthy and positive sanskars is a wonderful aim for a parent. The Brahma Kumaris offer many courses in developing good sanskars – Positive Thinking, Overcoming Anger, Stress Free Living, True Self Esteem, etc. If your parenting responsibilities do not allow you to attend a class, you can find some of these courses online. As you develop your own positive sanskars, you will be able to guide your daughter to do the same. In her infancy, you can help her shape good sanskars by allowing her to join you when you practice meditation, and by maintaining a peaceful and harmonious atmosphere in the home.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Raja Yoga Meditation helps us become more table and peaceful. The brain supports the soul during meditation practice, and eventually the brain learns ways to automatically maintain a higher level of calm. In some forms of mental illness, or due to some medications for mental illness, the brain does not respond to meditation in standard ways. The brain may even respond in ways that are harmful. This is why doctors sometimes say that meditation should not be practiced by people who are being treated for mental illness. In the case of your wife, it may be possible for her to practice having peaceful and positive thoughts, which is the first step in meditation. Check if your doctor is familiar with this practice and can suggest a practice that would be beneficial for your wife. If your doctor is not familiar with meditation practices, you might want to see if there is another doctor who is more knowledgeable in this area. Raja Yoga Meditation cannot treat mental illness. We always recommend that people follow the doctor’s advice in attempting meditation when mental illness is involved.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Love is an intrinsic energy of a soul, an energy that the soul can use to sustain itself and also to connect with others. When our love feels depleted, we turn to others to supply us with love. This makes relationships difficult and unfulfilling. In Raja Yoga we learn a method of connecting with the Supreme Soul whose love is always pure, benevolent and available. When we are strong in love ourselves, we can enter into healthy loving relationships with others.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[It is very difficult to watch the suffering of loved ones and not get involved. However, the more we suffer along with them, the less capable we are of extending any genuine help. When our family members are suffering, they are not able to create their own peaceful, positive and loving thoughts. Their energy gets completed depleted. Out of love for them, we need to detach from their problems and recognize that they need to resolve their own issues. However, we can help by being a positive influence. Visualize the family problems being resolved. Do not discuss the problems with others; just focus your energy on positive outcomes. Encourage your family members to stop being thinking and speaking about your brother’s difficulties, as negative energy only makes the situation worse. See yourself as an agent of peace. Practice feeling peaceful inside, and practice sending peaceful thoughts to your family members.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[13 year old boys go through many internal changes which can make them impulsive, moody and unstable. They need parental guidance that is both loving and firm. The parents may sometimes respond to the children by being annoyed or fearful. This can further confuse the child. If your son has become unmanageable in the home and at school, you might want to consult a child specialist. A specialist can help your son manage his feelings and help you and your husband create guidelines and consequences for his behavior. Each family member can contribute to a higher level of harmony and peace in the home. You can take the first steps towards this. It might take a little time and patience for your husband and son to understand the importance of their contributions.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[When we get involved in painful relationships, there is often some pull from our past that is keeping us there. The pull may be old habits of misjudging, or it could be old karmic patterns. Either way, the best thing to do is to create new, healthy ways of being in relationships. This starts with taking an assessment. You mentioned that you have shed lots of tears and your studies are suffering. How would you like to feel? What would you like to gain from your studies? Both your present state of well-being and your future professional life need some attention right now. They can’t get that attention when your emotions are draining your energy. Perhaps, with great love and sensitivity, you could step away from the relationship for a little while to ask yourself what would be best for you. This takes a lot of courage and faith in the self. When you have some clear answers, you will feel calmer inside and better able to concentrate.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Overcoming anger is something that we each have to do for ourselves. However, we can create an atmosphere that helps other people to stay peaceful. To do this, we must diligently practice peace. The phrase “Om shanti” means “I am a peaceful soul.” This is an eternal truth. In the Brahma Kumaris, we say “Om shanti” silently to the self frequently during the day, and let the feeling and understanding of being a peaceful soul circulate throughout our consciousness. We often practice this before performing an action, and then hold this consciousness during the action. Over time, the inner feeling of peace strengthens, so much that we are not very much influenced by disturbances around us. Also, if we intentionally practice this for longer periods of time, we can create an atmosphere of peace that affects other people, and allows them to feel relaxed inside.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[It’s a beautiful goal to give your daughter a bright future even though the present seems a little dark for you. As you become strong and clear about who you are, you will be able to transmit that strength and clarity to your daughter. Inside each human body is a soul, a tiny sparkling star, which is neither male nor female. We humans have the tendency to give value to each other based on the type of body. But Raja Yoga teaches us that all souls are beautiful, immeasurably valuable children of God. Through Raja Yoga meditation we practice this perspective. We connect with the Supreme Soul, absorb love and power, and slowly gain self respect and self confidence. Others may see us very differently but we stand firm on the awareness that we are souls and children of God. It might be very energizing to expose yourself to this spiritual knowledge. It is offered free of charge at Brahma Kumaris centers. Once your energy returns, you can use it to rid yourself of fears and tensions, and invest your energy in creating a happy and positive future for your daughter.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Raja Yoga meditation is the practice of controlling the mind through understanding how it functions, accumulating spiritual power, and diligently and peacefully guiding the mind in positive directions. To fully succeed at this, one would need to be free from habitual use of addictive substances. Full success would mean that the mind stays fairly peaceful and positive most of the time, and when negative emotions come, their energy passes without causing harm to the self or others. It is best to have a qualified teacher to guide you. You would also need to gradually reduce your consumption of bhang. Yes, when you are under its influence, it may seem that you can do many things easily. But that is an illusion. Your mental abilities are actually blocked then. One needs a clear and clean mind to take up meditation.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[My experience is with Raja Yoga meditation, which is a little different from the Buddha’s path. However, the concepts of nirvana and bhodi are somewhat universal. Nirvana is a place of absolute peace, bliss and silence. In Raja Yoga, this is considered to be the “permanent home” of the soul and also the place of residence of the Supreme Soul. The soul cannot go to this place until it has finished its journey on Earth. However, in Raja Yoga meditation, one can turn the attention towards this place and have an experience of being there. This is a nice antidote to the stress and uncertainty of life in the world. Bhodi refers to an awakened consciousness. One can have this in the midst of an ordinary life, by practicing the awareness that we are the invisible, eternal spiritual beings inside the body, looking out at the world through the eyes. In Raja Yoga we call this heightened awareness soul consciousness. A soul is a being of peace, love, bliss, purity and power. So, bodhi, or soul consciousness, means to stay awake to my spiritual nature, use my spiritual qualities in daily life, and give myself some time each day to step away from the business of life and enjoy the tranquility within.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Divorce is indeed a serious trauma and it is bound to evoke stress and anger. It is important to realize that even with the best of intentions we sometimes make wrong decisions. Everyone makes wrong decisions, and we can learn valuable lessons from them. Now that the marriage is over, it is important to not carry the trauma of that eight months into the future. You can create new stories about yourself and your life, and even be able to look at your past in new ways. This all begins with understanding that you are a soul, a divine being, and a child of the Supreme Soul. The more you can see yourself this way, the more you can forgive yourself (and others) for bad decisions of the past, and focus your energy on creating a better future. The Brahma Kumaris offer a 7 Days Course in Raja Yoga that explains how to think as a spiritual being and take control of your thoughts. You can learn how to let go of thoughts that cause you to suffer and create thoughts that are empowering. With the knowledge of Raja Yoga, you can make steady progress towards feeling better about yourself and creating a worthwhile life for yourself. The anger may be with you for a while, but it will not control you. You, the beautiful soul, will win over the anger in the end.]]></description>
