			<description><![CDATA[God does not have a physical body and therefore cannot be “seen” with the eyes. However, it is possible to feel the presence of God, or the closeness of God, because without the restrictions of a physical body, God’s energy can travel anywhere. In Raja Yoga meditation, we develop the abilities to connect with God by understanding His qualities and then opening ourselves to experiencing them. Generally, when people encounter God, they experience sublime states of love, peace or happiness. These are core qualities of a human soul, and so we all can recognize them. The Supreme Soul also has these qualities, in their most perfect state, all the time. By connecting with the pure and perfect energy of God, one can bring his/her own energy to higher states of purity and strength.]]></description>
