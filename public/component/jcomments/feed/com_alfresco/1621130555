			<description><![CDATA[I get hope from my knowledge about the existing holy spirit. It gives me his spiritual sending me answers for all makes me write that answers in the power of words. With useful in their true sense. This is how the spirit works - he gives word by word to us. In sence-setting use of his gift. This way he chose to all of us. I have to write such messages. It is no more the time for questions but it seems obvious to be the time. Inmidst of our generation this shall be Said and Skripted: We receive Words now in a full spirit of a godsoul Sense from Holy Hights]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Thank you Janki didi. Love makes you feel for others.You try to do what you can to help others in that compassion and without any expectation. This service can be done at one's own work place. Doing one's own duty sincerely, as work is worship. The reward is your remuneration. One can serve others in their leisure time, or in their retirement. The feeling of giving should be there and the giver is the benificiary as it gives satisfaction and happiness.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Namita and Janki: Each of us is given time, if we have respect for our time and use it in a worlthwhile way, time will serve us.  If we have value for somthing we take great care of it, we will get the reward of that.  Like anything, the more we pay attention to it the more it will flourish.]]></description>
