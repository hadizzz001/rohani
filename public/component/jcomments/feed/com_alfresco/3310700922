			<description><![CDATA[Dear BKI am reading, listening the philosophies of BK from last 8 years with inbetween gaps of time. It has been very appealing as it was rational but i am nearly not able to bring it to higher level than at just knowledge level.Life has be difficult, well it is trying to teach me something....and i am taking long to learn it as i was stuck with my old habbits or sanskars. I have a question: If somebody is doing injustice at one front and doing very good with other person. Which one will decide the final result of both karmas (good at one and injustice at other level)]]></description>
