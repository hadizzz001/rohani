			<description><![CDATA[Ashwani Rohilla:  To get to know Gods's plan you must quiten your own mind, so that you can hear.  To quiten your mind you need to become concious of yourself as a soul.  God is the Supreme Soul and so you need to get on the same wave-length.  God's wave length is pure - without static or intruptions.  This is something that needs practice but the more practice, the more you will experiene yourself to be this - a soul.  Also to know God's plan you need to start to follow God's directions - and even if you think you have not heard these directly from God - God's directions would surely be to live by the highest code of conduct, to hear no evil, see no evil and speak no evil, to love all souls as brothers, and to bring benefit to all.  The more you follow these directions the closer you will come to know God's Plan.  One step of courage brings thousand fold help from God.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dear Dadi JankiThank you for introducing these various plans . You have done this at the call of time in Oxford .i was amazed the first time and even asked you how am I going to understand what god s plan is .i was just talking about this last night with a friend who also was trying to understand these plans but we couldn't put a name to what was happening and this morning as I sat down to meditate I wanted to look at the site and there you are again whispering about the plan and the plans ..now I shall meditate to understand what these plans are and how to read them for guidance. Om shanti]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dear Janaki Dadi,Om Shanti, I agreed on the part of God's plan and our plan. Also if we get connected we'll know about his plans. But the question is how we get to know about his plans. We can only try by going to their places, like temple, gurduwara and all. Or try to do meditation. But Still not able to clear the plan and get upset. If you could guide us the path to see the plans being developed by almighty God.Om Shanti, Ashwani Rohilla]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[What has happened, is happening and will happen is the drama. Everything in life happens according to how it exactly happened. There is no change in the changing event of things. We are all actors having our roles in this drama of life, so act your role well and watch others detachedly while they play their roles. Dont interfere in peoples life but contribute positively to their life by teaching them, knowledge and yoga.]]></description>
