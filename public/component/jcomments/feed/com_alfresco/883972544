			<description><![CDATA[Thanks Dadiji for the message. I had always heard about drishti but by learning that we can make our intellect pure by our elevated thoughts and pure drishti now i will use your message in my day to day life. Thank you for your words which I remember during my morning meditation and these words give nourishment to the soul which last throughout the day. om shanti]]></description>
