			<description><![CDATA[Om shantiRespected DADIJI,THANK U for such an enlightening message. But dadi there are so many persons in this world who live in poverty. They do not have food to eat and clothes to wear. And Some even don't have shelter or homes to live. They are forced to live their life in misery and pain.In such case the lives of these people becomes a throny jungle. But they don't choose it. Their life itself becomes throny. In such situation how can they choose to live in a garden?? Can these people have right to choose between garden and jungle??]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[This is so true....our world is our own creation. We choose to make a garden or a jungle of thorns around us with our thoughts and actions. If we become aware of this, life will become so simple. But getting this awareness and realzing we have the power to choose is not so easy.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Some 13 years ago, from a bubbly, very energetic person, I became, overnight, a physically challenged being. Conventional medicine did not have much for me but every morning just the thought of Dadi and what she wasout to do,  which infused magic and enthusiasm in me. I would just gather the strength to jump out of bed and do my share of creating the new beautiful garden.Thank You. Thank You. Thank You Dadi .Om Shanti.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[ Lakshmi, to have a peaceful life you have to be peaceful.  God is the Ocean of Peace, the Ocean of Love and the Ocean of Happiness.  As a child of God this is also your true nature.  When you are feeling vexed this is because you are being influenced by anger.  To reconnect with your inner peace and realize that you, the soul are peaceful by nature, I suggest you learn meditation. If you want you can visit one of the Brahma Kumaris centers where they teach meditation.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Manesh:  It is good that we are positive in our interactions with others, as these are good actions and we will get the return of these.  If someone doesn't respond in an equally positive way, that is their choice, perhaps at that time they are being influenced by a circumstance that may have nothing to do with you.  Whatever the reason for their negativity, they need our good wishes and pure feelings to help give them strength to face whatever circumstances they are going through.  If someone is hurt physically we automatically help them.  Many people are hurt emotionally and need help.  We can offer this help by keeping our own positivity and given them good wishes.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Raajive:  Just as with anything we have to keep practicing, choosing to put a full stop to wasteful thoughts that bring no benefit but only more sorrow.  The first step is to understand, but nothing will change unless we think about this deeply, reflect on the reality of not going over and over something that causes ourselves sorrow, then with this realization we have the power to more easily choose not to waste our time in this way, but to choose happiness.  The more do something the stronger the habit becomes.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dadiji, thank you once again for giving us such a wonderful piece of advice on how to make our lives happy and remain cheerful. However, at times, even though we have immense faith in God and we know that he would help us in trying times, we still get drifted and keep on thinking why somthing bad has happened with me, resulting in loss of peace and tranquility. How do we handle such situations.Regards,]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dadi maa,Namaste.Our intuition always makes us to think just the way of questioning everything. Controlling our thoughts is difficult to achieve. But, as you blessed us with your Word of the Almighty, The Supreme Creator has provided us all the answers for such questions thus making our life easier. Hope we humans will be able to emulate the path towards this garden of self-realization where the Utopian happiness exists perennially.Thank you very much.]]></description>
