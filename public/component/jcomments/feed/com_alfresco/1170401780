			<description><![CDATA[Purusottam rout: limited desire is desire for things that limit the soul, which are tempory.  Unlimited desire is a wish to progress spiritually and strive towards or develop that which is eternal, for example our relationships with God, and that which is inate within all of us; such as godly virtues and powers.  We already have these within but they have deminished and so we have to cultivate them to make them grow.  Meditation is a tool for this - meditation is not just to control the senses.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om Shanti!Yes, my humble experience in meditation has shown me that connecting with Supreme Being, God, and dropping all attachments to materials and relationships creates intense contentment and self development, wisdom and healing.This doesn't mean not having materials or close relations, it means continually practicing the process of letting go of our conditioned thoughts and threads of energy that bind us to others. In this way we can see clearer and connect with divinity and infinite resource of creative energy to serve others and nature more effectively.love to all,Caspar]]></description>
