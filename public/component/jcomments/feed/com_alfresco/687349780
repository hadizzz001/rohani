			<description><![CDATA[Trupti:  Om shanti.  You are being influenced by outside circumstances.  Re-read Dadi's message and practice what she shares and your inner happiness will grow and then perhaps you will be able to bring more happiness into the world.  Anger does not contribute to good.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Happiness is an aura of feelings. That aura is created when one is able to bond emotionally with their loved ones. When there is a hickup in the bonding then there is a negative thought and that feeling of happiness dissapears and negative thoughts take over. Our mere presense on this earth is ability to bond with the loved ones and that struggle or journey takes majority of ones life and at the end of the lifes journey one gives up being tired with the process and goes into silence.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Avni.  Perhaps reading the response to Dinesh's message might help.  Also you may want to take some quite time to look back on what happened 5 years ago that made your attitude change so much.  Dissatisfaction with life usually comes from dissatisfaction with the self.  It is good that you have realized that your unhappiness and anger is coming from you, because this means that you also have the power to change.  Understanding that originally you are a peaceful being filled with qualities of love, peace, happiness and truth allows you to access these qualities.  They are yours - you don't have to get them from anywhere else.  Meditation is a good way to access and experience these qualities within yourself.  By spending time in introversion, and experiencing your qualities you will then be able to bring these into your life as you in turn become extrovert. (come into action).]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Five years back, I was a very happy person.But today, I am the most unhappy person on earth.I am highly dissatisfied with my life.I lose temper easily on little things or slight disconnect/disagreement over little things, and get violent verbally.I lose control and speak very harsh at time, and later acknowledge that it was wrong the way I behaved and spoke.Please help me as I know this is not right and I want to become a better/good person in life atleast in my own eyes by not being harsh to anyone.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dinesh:  It is good that you are taking such benefit from Happiness Unlimited.  Regarding your son.  There is really nothing you can do to diminish your son's temper - he has to do it for himself.  The first step would be for him to recognize that he has a problem and then want to fix it. Then he could investigate for himself different avenues that he could take.  There are organizations that do 'Anger Management courses.  The Brahma Kumaris also offer this at some of their centers which include meditation - which is very helpful as there is also the opportunity to connect with who we really are so that we can develop self-respect, have a deeper understanding of how to create good relationships and good actions and to receive support from God.  Regarding how you deal with your sons temper - there are always choices of how to respond and with the development of your own spiritual journey you will begin to make choices that will help you and indirectly your son.  Having pure and powerful good wishes and love with understanding will definitely help everyone.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[“A little goes a long way.” Add a few drops of red wine to a glass of water and all of the liquid turns pink. Add a few drops of divine insight to this life and you begin to live in that glow. While it may be a waste of fine wine, it is an excellent use of the soul. Most doctors say that drinking a glass of red wine each day is good for your heart. Most of the spiritual teachers recommend that we drink in a little divine spirit daily to add heart to our lives. It enhances our being.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dharmesh:  Perhaps re-reading the message help.  Real and constant happiness comes from the soul being nurtured by spiritual truth, this is something that needs to be 'taken' consistently - every day.  The darkness of ignorance is removed by the light of truth - ignorance (body consciousness) brings sorrow and truth (soul consciousnesses)  brings happiness.  When we realize who we really are, imperishable immortal souls, beings of light and children of God - in this awareness - there is true and lasting happiness.]]></description>
