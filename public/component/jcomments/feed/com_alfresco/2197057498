			<description><![CDATA[It is good you are taking benefit for these messages and from the Awakening programs.  Use some of the practices espoused in them and it will help you to let go of the past and focus on creating a new and better future.  You have taken your exams and so whatever is the result of your study will be.  Focus on the present, realize who you are, practice your Dharma and your beautiful qualities will emerge.  Draw strength from God who is your Father, Teacher and Friend.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Brijesh Kumar:  God is an incorporeal being of light - the Supreme Soul - our spiritual parent.  Just as we are incorporeal beings of light (like tiny stars) so too is God.  However, we adopt bodies to play our parts in this drama of life on the physical plane 'He' doesn't have a body of His own - which allows Him to keep the purity of all his atributes.  He is the 'seed' of the 'human world tree' and is completely knowledgeful.  Though God is this tiny subtle being of light His qualities are vast as He is the Ocean of Love, Peace, Truth, and Happiness.  As our Parent we can receive our inheritance of the these qualities from Him by connecting to him through mediation (yoga).  If you want to find out more about this, perhaps you would like to contact your local BK center which you can find by going to www.brahmakumaris.org or from this website by going to "a Center Near You". ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Respected Dadiji Excellent message. Practically achieviable, but in some cases we fail to be cheerful always, because unnecessary hurdles come in our way which creates a lot of tension and distracts all our thought of soul conscious stage to that particular problem. At that time we forget every aspect of soul conscious state and suddenly illusion overpowers us. Please guide us to attain that stage, though whatever problem arises infront of us with Gods remembrance we feel happy and tension free. Thanks, with regards and respect.]]></description>
