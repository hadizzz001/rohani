			<description><![CDATA[Yes,it's a really great power that holds the keys to one's peace and happiness, lightness - freedom.... and certainly one I want to cultivate...but my question is - it was said above that a tolerant person doesn't want to prove that he or she is right... but does this hold true even when he or she is being misunderstood? Isn't there a need to speak up at that moment? It does feeling draining,though and so,I know that I'm not doing the right thing...but I feel that the other person should understand where I am coming from... so could explain that a bit more please??]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Tolerance comes from being able to accommodate and merge.  Ignorance comes from not knowing 'fully'.  Sometimes without us being fully aware we become ignorant very innocently and so that does not mean we don't have the capacity to tolerate.  It means there is the need to just become fully aware and become a bit more wise and knowledgeble.  Many times throughout the day our tolerance levels are tested in big and small ways.  So definitely capacity is there, but our responses and reactions are different depending on the situation and circumstance.  When we ignore it means we have some capacity, but need the power to face. This is from my own personal experience. Hope it helps, Alka ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[om shanti.. the article finely describes the deepest and strongest power in us--Tolerance. This power needs to be explored; knowledge about it is just not enough. let us all be really tolerant and accept things and LET BE. (need to check whether we have to or we want to). Nice article, blessings to author. OM SHANTI.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[This article reveals the source of strength within us, but we don't wish to use it since we are scared of our false pride. The false pride may give us temporary relief but restricts our movements which we rarely realize. Why not enjoy a complete life which reduce the stress and strain from our brain? After all giving gives more pleasure than accepting. Best wishes]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[The article is SUPERB!!!Yep, I agree with the fact that tolerance is our best companion. Actually, earlier I used have a lot of problems with my loved ones. But nowadays things are changing since I am practicing the art of tolerance. But still I sometime feel depressed and question myself--why should I always tolerate them when they don't even see all my efforts to sustain the relationship?But today, reading this article, my understanding has widened and I feel so blessed. This article probably came just for me. :) THANK YOU]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Thank you. I will be meeting 40 six-year-olds today. They will be bubbling with enthusiam. I will gain strength by being loving and patient with them. In my interactions with them, I know I'll be looking at the reflection of myself in my innocent and pure being. Thank you for educating me from ignorance by publishing such inspirational articles. Om Shanthi.]]></description>
