			<description><![CDATA[Wonderful thought provoking article..Interesting to note that ultimately everything begins and ends with our 'thoughts', while we spend our entire life time seeking answers outside...The fact that we can stop the vicious cycle we ourselves create, is certainly encouraging!!!Om Shanti ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om shanti, These certainly are great thoughts that will help a lot of people to overcome their anxiety and deep sorrows which bind them in day to day life, often affecting them unknowingly, like in my case. They can work like a ray of hope after long darkness of grief, pain and sorrow.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Very enlightening read. I agree with the other Flora. Indeed a silver lining with the rainbow as well. This is especially so when we are conscious on the path to greatness and the people around you aren't...It's not coming from a place of judgment either, but rather the skills and practice of having to balance all that action in a real time world with the skills you have learned in order to propel yourself forward as a rightful peaceful spiritual citizen of the universe... Practice, refine, fine tune & re-do that all over and over and over again until it becomes the actual way of life...]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[WOW!!!!What an enlightening article!!!!This article is an eye-opener for me. Actually, I was having a very tough time with my loved ones. I've always tried my best not to make anyone unhappy. With this intention, I always said "yes,yes and yes" to them--while saying to myself "no,no and no". I was in a terrible condition until now. I was trying to please others, but at the same time I was neither able to prevent them from becoming unhappy nor was I able to protect myself from sorrow. Reading this article today totally changed my perception. I will try to implement this on a daily basis. I know it's not going to be easy, but at least I can give it a try. THANK YOU FOR THE ARTICLE]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Great article. This article has truly inspired and motivated me to check my thoughts--often! What really happens is that we try very hard not to hurt others and ourselves, but we always end up with a lot of wounds and pain. Reading this article, I feel enlightened. Now I will try to implement it in my everyday life. :) :)]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Well, a series of self talks and introspection have given me ideas about how to avoid hurting others, yet I fail often.... Today, by reading this article, I learned how great human beings cope with negative thoughts .....it created in me the determination: "LET'S RETURN TO OUR ORIGINAL IDENTITY".]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[The example of volley-balling, or the volleying of sorrow, makes it pretty clear how we can stop the circle of sorrow we keep on experiencing. Very beautifully explained. Thank you. In addition, the article helped me realize that not everything is my birthright and to be grateful for what I receive. This helps me stay on track.]]></description>
