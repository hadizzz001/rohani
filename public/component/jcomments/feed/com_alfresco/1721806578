			<description><![CDATA[Mala Nayar:  Karma means action.  We create karmic accounts on the basis of the actions we do. If we do good actions we receive 'credit' or fruit of that good action - if our action is negative we accumulate 'debit' which we will have to pay back one way or another.  Negative actions weaken the soul.  If we continue to do the same negative action we create a habit that weakens the soul even more.  In order to strengthen the soul we can choose to do good actions thus creating good habits and caracter that bring the fruit of happiness.  Remembering God and drawing power from God's company also decreases our negative Karma, as this is one of the most elevated Karma's we can do, it brings benefit to ourselves and to others. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Selvarani subramaniam,  Your fear has probably developed since you experienced difficulty in breathing. If you stop breathing the body dies.  Many people fear 'death'.  However, with the understanding that you are an imortal being of light, spirit, and can never actually die, this fear decreases, depending on the degree of realization and faith.   Meditation will help with this realization of the true imperishable self.]]></description>

I am very much impressed in her speech and since that very day I am attending regular class.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dear Dadiji - I agree and understand that we need to talk to GOD (our father) and I do so also. When I am puzzled I ask him question also and I do get answer also from him which makes me feel very lighter and satisfied. I talk to him and say thanks to him when I receive something good and when I face so called negative situation I take his expert advice also and I feel by doing this my life is moving satisfactory and happily.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dear Dadiji, Thank you for your message. Your messages are always loving, simple and clear. I have been experimenting with maintaing a link with God (Baba), and days/times when I am able to do this, it works out exactly as you have said- the situations dissolve, just melt away and leaves me always in wonder. At some stage when I found my mind troubling me even a bit, I decided to do the next experiment- literally giving up my mind to Baba and in exchange taking HIs. I was and continue to be overwhelmed by this one single step I took. Following Baba's directions became so easy!!!]]></description>
