But yesterday I found out the meaning of "om shanti" via BK audio I have been lost in a cage for a long time. I came out of it 2years ago by loosing my job. In the bigning I felt that I rather die. Now I feel every thing you, Shreen, said. Very happy with out any possesion!Om shanti from Finland + Sweden]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[This was well-worth watching! It helped me to again center on what is important in life and that "Self" and Knowledge thereof is more important than the money I lost in the Stock Markets. It has taken me all of this time to reconcile with simply "money lost" but this was a great reminder that both me and my family have also gained much, and really are doing well. Om Shanti!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Sister Chareen's comment that feelings of sorrow indicate that we're telling ourselves the wrong story is soooooo empowering. After having gone through years of sadness and disappointment, I'm finally at a point where I'm ready to own my part in it. I discovered the Haidar Medlej about 13 years ago and never fully explored your teachings as a way of freeing myself to be okay no matter what transpires around me. I'm now ready and am so grateful to have re-connected, as you offer me a viable path to spiritual enlightment and ultimate peace. Thank you.]]></description>
