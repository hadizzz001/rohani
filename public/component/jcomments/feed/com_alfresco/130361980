			<description><![CDATA[Chris Ukah:  Today's world can be very noisy, especially in cities and towns.  Meditation can help you to step into your inner world and leave behind the external noisy world.  For this you need practice and concentation and a real desire and internest to discover this inner silence and beauty.  Your mind actually is drawn to where your real interest lies.  However, sometimes going away into the country or a quite physical place can help you to make that connection. Inevetably you have to go back to your everyday noisy life, but your quite retreat refreshes you and the experience you were able to have in quiteness can be re-emerged in the not so quite enviroment.  Sometimes even in quite places, the noise in your mind also prevents you from connecting to your peace, so ultimately we have to learn to quiten our minds and close our ears to external things and focus on our inner reality.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Thanks Dadi Janki. I have been noticing that questions I am wondering about are quite often answered when I read your messages. I feel as though God is providing me with these answers so that I can continue to transform myself. In particular, only yesterday, I was telling my husband that he needs to become more spiritual. Now I know that it is pointless to try to transform others - that he will transform as I continue to do so.Om Shanti.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Taking love from God (Baba) and having love and good wishes for the self an everyone is the key to transformation. When someone defames you,the problem is in them. But what happens is we go over it in our minds and then the problem become ours, it spoils our peacefulness. The prayer let me be an instrument of your, peace where their is hatred let me sow love, where there is injury pardon.Let me not try to be understood, but to understand.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Raajive:  It is good that you keep practicing your meditation as this will help you recieve the power you need to put spiritual knowledge into practice.  One of the principles of spiritual knowlege is that the past is the past, and it is no good going over in your mind things that you should or should not have done.  Obsicals and illusion (Maya) are your teachers, think of them as cooperating with you, teaching you a lesson rather than thinking of them as your enemy.  Don't be afraid or frustrated, just learn the lesson.  Sometimes they come to teach you tolerace, sometimes to be a piller of peace.  If you learn the lessons you will become spiritualy strong.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Khushi Sharma:  Forgiveness is a quality that is filled with love and strength.  If we are experiecing low self-esteem then that feeling is coming from a lack of self-respect.  We cannnot control how others act, they are responsible for their own actions and I am responsible for how I respond. The seed of tolerance, love, is sown with compassion and care.  The more one becomes loving and shares that love, the greater the power in that love.  When there is lack of love, there is lack of tolerance. For instance, the example of mother and child: When an obstacle comes to a child, because the mother has love for that child, she is prepared to and has the power to tolerate anything. At that time she does not worry about her own well-bing but uses love to confront all circumstances.  Love makes anything easier to tolerate. There is benefit in strengthening our love, first of all for ourselves and then for others.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dear Dadi,There are people who take advantage of other people's innocence.These innocent people keep being nice despite the rudeness and insensitivity from those apathetic people. But, there is a limit to one's tolerance. Also,there is a question of fairness and justice. So, how can we deal with peoplewho are only concerned about themselves and who exploit others for one's benefits? One can forgive them a number of times but forgiving them alwaysbrings low self esteem in oneself and one tends to lack confidence in self.Therefore, please help find solution or correct me if I am wrong.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dear Dadi, thank you so much for another wonderful message, this is really very powerful and inspiring. I make it a point to read all your messages to southern the soul and remove the negativity surrounding us in many forms and regularly do meditation since the time I have come across BK and gained the knowledge. However, at times, while we intend to remain perfect and follow the guidelines, we do get distracted by worldly things and repent later on for deviating from the path, which brings in frustration and sorrow. How can we overcome this ? We need you to guide us with your insight. OS.]]></description>
