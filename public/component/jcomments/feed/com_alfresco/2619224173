			<description><![CDATA[anand:  We suggest you go to your local BK center to find out in detail about some of the things you are asking about and to learn meditation which will help you to experience your true self and your unique role in life. We understand ourselves to be incaporeal eternal beings of light and God also to be an incaproeal being of light so in that sense God does have a form/image but it is not physical sense, because the soul cannot be seen with these physical eyes.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Prachi Joshi:  Relationships in this day and age can be complicated, as so much karma has been created.  If you have tried to explain yourself to your friends and they have chosen not to forgive you - then that is their loss, not only because of the friend they will be loosing but also to keep sorrow in the heart and mind hurts the person holding the sorrow first.  However, as a friend of theirs it is your task to keep good feelings in your heart for them and send them pure feelings and good wishes without any expectation of return.  This will lighten your heart and also theirs in an incognito way, and all will benefit.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Namaste DadiOm shanti !thanks for guidance! I was bit confused but now I am clear about the concept forgiveness. I want to keep in my mind good moments spend with my beloved ones (my Pitaji who died & my love who left from my life because of parents' rejection); but I want do it without the feeling of hurt. I was not able to proceed with my life because of that hurt & sorrow. So I started meditating with the help of Sister Shivani's program on astha. Now I am completely out of the feeling of hurt & sorrow & I don't dwell in the past while remembering good moments spend with both of them.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Prachi Joshi:  It is good that you have forgiven and forgotten things that have hurt you in the past.  It is fine to remember times of happiness, friendship and loved ones.  However if your remembrance keeps you in the past then this will hold you back from moving on with your life.  So remember with lightness and happiness, but don't dwell there.  Share the love you receive from God with all you meet today. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dear Dadi ! I have always experienced that its easy to forgive than to forget, over the years i realized that we should forget others mistakes and not the lessons we learnt from that. But, after reading your message i feel that we should forget even the lessons so that we remain neutral without bias and perform our acts with love. I love that message. Thanks Dadi]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Purva,True forgiveness is a very deepspiritual practice.  Sometimes we thinkwe have forgiven but we are still holding on to traces of blame and resentment andit is those traces that invite the negative response.  When we truly forgive then people will truly respectus. I would suggest re-reading Dadiâ€™s posting,sit and reflect on it for a while and then practice with love this deep forgivingand forgetting over a period of time and see the result.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Narinder,Whether or not you experience sorrow from others is up toyou.  We need to develop a deep sense ofself respect balanced with mercy in order to forgive and forget.  In this state of self respect; because ofbeing connected to your true self and your innate qualities you will find itnatural to forgive.  You will understandthat the other is acting from their own insecurities and you will be able tohave compassion for that ones state of being. As it says in the message from Dadi, the alternative is to have theoffenders face in your mind as you go over and over the offense causing, andkeeping yourself sorrow.  Forgiving andletting go heals and makes you strong. Who then becomes the winner? . . . both; the forgiver and the forgiven. We often turn to God to be forgiven and ask that He forgetour transgressions, with the full expectation that it will be so.  We are thankful that He offers rest andcomfort. With Gods company we will receive the power of realization not repeatthe offense. We tend not to think of God as an idiot because he forgives usagain and again, we are thankful God is powerful enough to do this!  We can then move forward and do better.]]></description>
