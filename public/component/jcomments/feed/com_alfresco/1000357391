			<description><![CDATA[Ramit Chaudhary: The law of karma is very accurate and will give the return of what ever actions are done. It is also a very subtle mechanism that takes into account many things behind our actions we do like attitude etc.  It is also very intricate and is like a web, one thing connecting to another.  The important and great thing about understanding the law of karma is that we have the opportunity to pay as much attention to our attitude and actsion as we can, so that our minds and hearts are full of good wishes and pure feelings for everyone, so whatever actions we do uplift ourselves and the other and in so doing we free ourselves and the the world from the effects of negative actions.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om Shanti.Since having joined B.K I am calmer, more aware and in touch with my spiritual self and those of others.What Dadi Janki says is true - this is a time for spiritual friendships - mine began almost a year ago and has brought me here.Whilst on my journey I've met remarkable women on an identical quest and I am grateful to God for His infinite Mercy for guiding me thus.Sending Light Love and Peace to my loving teacher Shirley, from Harmony House Claremont,to my dear friend Yasmin who introduced me, to my budding B.K sisters, Aafiyah, Shakila and Aakira,and of course, to our entire world.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Brahmakumaris like many great gurus say that consciousness is in the centre of brain. But some say it is in heart. I do feel strong in the heart though I fail to get anything between the brows. Actually how to moderate this problem. Moreover though it is said that the whole universe is in our microcosm, by watching our thought flow reaching the Sakshi Bhava no such Universe is felt inside. Only the vibrating current like presense of Jeeva, nothing else is . once i disolve in that feel when the mind is nomore, how to come back to normal worldly state without being lost there forever though]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I have a query regarding law of karma.Suppose first person do some bad karma against second person. Now, according to the law-of-karma, second person is returning what he get from the first person. So my question is whether the second person will got the punishment for the returning act against first person OR he is free from it because he is a part of divine plan to return the things he get from first person?]]></description>
