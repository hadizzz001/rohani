			<description><![CDATA[Indeed there is much sorrow and sadness in the world.  In order to bring change we will have to change our response to it.  Turning within the self and connecting to our innate qualities, such as love, peace and truth through meditation and linking with the source of these qualities - God - anables us to bring these much needed qualities into the world.  By changeing our focus we will begin to experience happiness which we will then automatically share with others.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Pragatigogia: It is good to have respect for every being.  Our elders are included in this.  If we have self-respect it will be easy for us to have humility and respond with peace and understanding. We may not agree with what someone says or does but our love and respect for the person should not deminish. If we are wanting to prove ourselves for any reason then ego is present.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dear brother amit, We get relationships according to our past life energy interactions.If we take some money from someone we need to return him after some days likewise if I ,the soul has to return something(not always object it can be returning in the sense of thoughts words and actions) to some other soul or vice versa I have to take a body surrounding to that soul to return him or to experience the return from that soul.I the soul do it birth after birth.So now is the time to wake up and have good interaction with everyone in the world becoz this world belongs to us.we all are souls]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I agree with you Dadi ji that we should become egoless and viceless. If we all start working on it we will certainly improve day by day and a day will come when we will be really an angel. Once we have achieved this stage then people around us will also definitely try to become like us and gradually this world will become a beautiful place. We all know that good company helps us to become a better person and once we try to improve GOD also helps us to do so. Than you Dadi ji for all your help.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[our 5sense organs and the mind are our sensitive organs which serve as instruments to deceive us. All we see with our physical eyes are temporary. Whatever we become, we must unbecome someday. Nothing is ours. We own nothing such that we dont own even our body. We were born empty and must leave empty. Attachment to persons, place or property is the cause of all sorrow and pains, be detached. To think that "you are an owner" is wrong. Dont feel angry or fight because of losing or gaining temporary material things. Om shanti]]></description>
