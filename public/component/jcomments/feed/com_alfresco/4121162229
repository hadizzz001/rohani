			<description><![CDATA[Janine:  An important significance of spiritual growth is to realize that each one is an actor playing their individual part on this world stage.  Each actor has to pay attention to his/her own part and to play their part to the best of their ability.  While paying attention to one's own part, it is also a good practice to be a detached observer to the part of others.  This practice of being a detached observer will allow you to be the following:  a.  To separate yourself from what others are doing and not to define yourself through the actions of others. b.   To stay true to your own innate values and not to compromise them while interacting with others. c.   To invest your resources into things that are meaningful with long-lasting impact e.g. your daughter's education without expecting others to do the same. d.    To be the master of who you are and not to become the victim of those around you.  The practice of meditation fills the self with inner strength to do the above.  Hope this helps you to understand the power of practice.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Like all others writing messages to Dadi,I find those words beautiful. The problem is to practice.I have had a partner for 35 years, half of these years he has not been able to keep a job. I've been the main provider for the family. All the money he makes he spends in expensive stuff for his own pleasure like expensive watches, pens , hi-fy, etc. He inherited some real estate and money which by law are not mine. I'am helping our daughter in college.I tried to make him understand how unfair this is,to no avail. How can I learn to accept his way of living without resentment?]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Kirandeep: As with all practices – and meditation is apractice – you have to put the time and energy into it.  Sometimes we sit to do meditation, but don’treally focus and so we only get a minimal benefit.  When we sit in the awareness of being a spiritualbeing, a peaceful soul, we can detach a little and understand that we are thecreator of our thoughts and put a ‘full stop’ to negative thoughts that lead tosorrow and frustration and create the thoughts we want to; thoughts of peaceand harmony, thoughts of good wishes for the self and others.  Whatever thoughts we create, so will be ourfeelings.   Also remember that your twolittle babies are souls also, and actually belong to God, and so with thisrecognition, you can detach a little and give them pure spiritual love and careand let go of feelings of attachment which will cause stress and sorrow.  Hope this helps.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dear Dadiji, the message is really very motivating and inspiring, it gives so much of energy and force to proceed ahead in life leaving the past behind and remaining cheerful and in spiritual intoxication. Especially, the advice "to think that someone else should change is a big mistake" is absolutely true. We waste so much of our time thinking about others and things happened in the past and end up in spending too much of energy in trying to change others. Your message and advice is really amazing and we shall follow the same. Thank you Dadiji for showing us the right path.Best Regards,]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Good morning dear dadiji yes its a powerful and important era now all of us are going through a wonderful transformation,its the cleansing of the soul.now dadi has said to give attention to ourselves it's true because whatever we speak and we do its will be reflected in the transformation age ,i don't think we will get pure by outside intoxication but what we think and the quality of thought is very important,,its better to go abide the wasteful thoughts and re transform them to useful thoughts it is only possible trough deep and constant meditation with God (Shiv Baba) om shanti]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[The desire is certainly to remain cheerful and with spiritual intoxication and sweetness. However, the mind seems to be so much in control that the spirit feels spirited only when the mind 'allows' it to. Although spirit is supreme, for an entry level aspirant it appears to be subservient.Thank you for conveying a simple message. I am sure along with your love, it will give us insights for permanent spiritual intoxication..without highs and lows..]]></description>
