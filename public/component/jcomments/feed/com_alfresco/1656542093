This takes determination, but when you have your attainment from the study in front of you, this gives power.  Detach yourself from all other destractions.  It is easier to let go of distractions when you have an aim and see the attainment.  Also when you set your mind on somthing and complete it, this gives faith and confidence in the self.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[What the world needs now is peace, peace, peace!! through knowledge as given by God, the Supreme Soul and pure living. Time is warning us to change ourselves so as to change the world. When we become new, only then can the world become new. Newness is practicing to always keep pure positive thoughts, truthful words and non-violent acts. To change ourselves, we must start it now, with small small little little practice of pure thinking within our minds. Om shanti is the way]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om Shanti. 2012 had been the worst year of my life. I happily bid goodbye to 2012 but yet can't welcome 2013 wholeheartedly as I am still feeling the pain. I have taken the decision to step out of the problem but this transition period is quite tough for me. Every day I break down and every day I get up. I don't feel much positive for future as in what I wished for. But just hope to stay peaceful in life. I am reading ur messages and listen Sister Shivani too... Its helpful... Thanks...]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Kanishka Shandilya:  We have to pay attention to our thinking if we want to change our thoughts.  Become an observer and see what thoughts your mind is creating and if you don't like them, change it as soon as you think it.  Change to a thought that is positive, brings you power and benefit.  Then your words and actions will also change. Pay attention in this way and keep doing it and your habit of thinking in the way you don't like will change.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dear Dadi, What a beautiful image to hold on to. Hand in hand with God as your constant companion. Take one step towards him and he takes a 100 steps towards you. Letting go of feelings when someone hurts you is hard as we keep replaying the hurt in our minds, but with Baba's (God's) help we can release and let go and return to inner peace.]]></description>
