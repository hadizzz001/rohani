			<description><![CDATA[MyKids: It is a big challenge when ones children are ill, and it can be difficult to remain peaceful.  When our children are ill we would do anything to make them better  . . . and one of the best things that you can do is to remain peaceful, calm and loving.  This will create an atmosphere of peace and lightness and will directly help the child - help them to feel safe and secure in the protection of God's light and peace.  Meditation will also help you access the extra strength you need. Being peaceful helps us to see things clearly, be patient and loving, and know that God is just a thought away.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[i feel tired and upset by the chaotic communications i receive through some person very close to me today. a friend mailed me some articles from this site and i appreciate the questions you posed about remaining peaceful and meditating in small increments throughout my day. most places where i visit feels empty of spirit and the physical bodies encasing the soul is like a impenatrateable suit..souls spirit do not touch ..as i exit collective spirits gathered for void in the experience..we are not seeking spirit just movement..i thank you and my friend for more light food that feeds my soul]]></description>
