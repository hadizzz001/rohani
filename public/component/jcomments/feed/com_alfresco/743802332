			<description><![CDATA[Sudhir: At this time most of our minds fluctuate, worry, and are generally unstable.  Meditation will help with this as we take time to leave aside all the issues and situations we have, and focus on our inner spiritual self.  As we turn inwards we begin to experience our own innate peace and silence, this connects us to our spiritual power as we become more self aware - soul concious - in this state of being aware of our selves as spiritual energy, points of light, we can also re-connect with the Supreme Soul, our spiritual Parent and can draw on the Godly qualities of peace, happiness, wisdom, purity and love.  The more time we spend in this true realtionship with the self and the Supreme Soul, our awareness, thoughts and attitude change; this then fillters through into our everyday activities. Our thoughts have become calmer, our responses to situations become wiser, our decisions are based on this spiritual reality which will bring a more peaceful and happier life.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[ashoka pittala.  Meditation will certainly help with concentration and brings an experience of peace.  But when it comes to concentrating on your studies it will help to cultivate the desire to learn, know your aim and objective,(what it is you want to achieve and why), and have the determination and a plan to carry it through.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Yes...knowing leads to understanding. When you understand something and make it a part of you...of your life, it becomes a way of life wherein you express everything you do according to that set of beliefs. You will also choose to be with people who can enhance this knowledge, be eager to be in their company because their presence will assist you to further your transformation. Together, you can create a vibration that can bring into existence that critical mass that will lift others to a transformed consciousness of peace, love, joy, compassion, understanding and acceptance. Om Shanti.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dadiji, once again a big thank you, for so clearly and systematically explaining the path to the attainment of spiritual knowledge and thus making the progress. The challenge is that, while the steps appear to be easy and simple to follow, when it comes to the practical reality we revert back to the original thought process and behaviuor. Nevertheless as you have mentioned, with your good wishes and God's blessings we shall make these actions part of our daily lives.Thank you once again. Om Shanti!]]></description>
