			<description><![CDATA[Bharti.  When we loose somthing we are attached to it will automatically keep coming in our thoughts.  When we focus on the things we have, appreciate them and care for them this will help thoughts of what you have lost to fade away.  What is gone is gone.  You have a husband and two lovely daughters to focus on.  However, do so as an instrument, as a child of God, as they are children of God, they and you belong to God. Be loving and not attached.  Attachment brings sorrow, love brings happiness to all.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Swati:  Thanks for sharing your feelings. To overcome any thing of the past silence is important but it is what you do in silence that is even more important.  So follow these three steps: Step 1: Self awareness. Who am I, and what is original to me?  I am a soul and my original and innate qualities are peace, love, joy, purity, and truth.   Connect your thoughts to these virtues or one of them. Step 2:  Who am I?  I am a child of God and the only one who knows me as I am is God.  His knowing me gives me my self respect, so connect to God with your original qualities and with your self respect. Step 3: Have a heart to heart conversation with God and release yourself from the burden of your past and commit to not going back to that past because it will weaken you but rather to go to God and take strength.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dadijiji what you say is hundred percent true.  Silence is a great healer. When nothing seems to be in our hands we should surrender everything to time and our beloved Baba (God) because it is said that above every human soul there works a supernatural force known as God and we are all his children.  He is our Father, He is our mother, He is our guide. So in-spite of discussing our problems with others lets share with God in a living relationship. If we sit in silence and something comes from our inner heart, we should work according to that. om shanti.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Good morning dadiji. Thanks for this wonderful message. Silence is a great healer. But we have become so clouded with our old belief system that we feel by sharing our worries with others they will be less, but on the contrary they bounce back to my court because that person hurt me once.  But by revising it made it as apart of recipe. So thanks dadiji, I got solutions to each of my problems from your messages they like pearls of wisdom. om shanti]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Yes, Dadiji you are absolutely correct. By remembering the hurtful things we get hurt again and again. So there is no need to remember it but we should remember God our Baba (Father).]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Geraldine:  Practice remaining silent inside and the sound of others will not affect you.  You cry because you take inside what others are saying and think about it until you feel unhappy and hurt.  Read again Dadi's message and reflect on it deeply and it will help.]]></description>
