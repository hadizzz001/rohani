			<description><![CDATA[Aparna:  Call your local BK center and speak to someone about the meditation course. If your husband is interested then he could attend the course.  We can only suggest opportunities, each one has to make up their own mind as to whether they take that opportunity or not.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[It seems some people misunderstand when it is said to 'pay attention to my self'. Paying attention self is not about being selfish and grab material pleasure for self, instead it is about looking at your inner soul which does not want materialism. Souls need to be nurtured upwards, SrimadBhagwat 6.5 says lift your soul upwards do not let it down, as it can be both your friend and Enemy depending on how intellect is used in nurturing the soul first, and later listening to it.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[vkas nath saxena:  Why do we pay attention to the self in a spiritual practice.  Actually in life we generally do not pay attention to the 'real, origional self' the soul.  We perhaps pay much more attention to our needs and desires.  Spiritual practice is to be in the awareness of the self as a spiritual being, with its origional qualities of love, peace, wisdom and happiness, and act accordinly.  If we did so, then our behavior change and we would bring benefit to ourselves, our families, and close connections.  The way we are in the world has a big influence and if we pay attantion to having pure feelings and good wishes for all then it can only bring benefit to the self, others and the world.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Very beneficial and effective lines posted by Dadi Ji. We are really blessed that we are able to create that thought which encourages us to read again and again. Dadi ji we are little children who sometimes forget to be self discipline. I myself had experience the positive effect of meditation. Everything can be change in one's personality. You don't need to do response artifically, positive responses comes naturally. Om Shanti!]]></description>
