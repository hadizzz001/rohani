			<description><![CDATA[baby: As Dadi has said, thinking about situations over and over make the soul heavy.  We generally have a bad habit of thinking about things too much, "He said, she said, why is this happening etc."  These wasteful and negative thoughts of worry and overthinking make us heavy.  If we start to have postitive creative thoughts to bring solutions, we will begin to feel lighter, and our energy will change.  The time it takes will depend on our commitment.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Menuka:  Attachment always brings sorrow, as you have probably experienced.  Expectations in whatever or whoever we are attached to rarely meet our desires.  If we focus instead on the attainment we receive from strenghting our spiritual selves and developing our relationship with God then we become happier, our relationships become more harmonious and our decision making will be better.  Better choices will lead to a happier life for us, our families and comunities.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[thank u so much dadi,first please accept my "pranam". i am really relieved after going via ur message. it sometimes becomes difficult to judge ur own thoughts. ur innerself knows and acknowledge every change in ur life but when it come to deliver ur thought into action it really seems painful. actually the attachments in our lives are so strong that it has put curtains in our mind and heart. i totally understand that one should not give uo on anyone. dadi can you please let me know how to detach yourself from those unwanted and foolish desires so that u can be wise and impartial.help me!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[That's the way forward...we all need to remember that the other person is also a soul and a child of God. Its also in their true nature to attain peace and by not giving up on them we leave the door always open for them to come back to their true state. Thank you Dadi...]]></description>
