Somehow we try to do it but unfortunately things come in our mind & we get back to square one. I always think, if some thing wasn’t a part of my future, why it happened with me, I was very happy the way I was living & that’s the time I don’t know, how to smile & be happy. I want to be keep quite.However, keeping what you have said. I will keep on trying to divert my mind & soul towards the supreme GOD, Who is the director of every chapter of our life!Please take care of yourself. Thnx,Aman]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Its very true. Your every message is empowering us. i have an experience this whatever u said. when I smile to forget whatever has happened it really makes me feel good. but we have to forget and let go the past to keep smiling, we only remember that we are soul and around me there is world drama in which every scene is accurate. bcoz it is the word of almighty authority my beloved supreme father lord shiv . ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Manoj Kumar.  Worry is a habit that many of us have now-a-days and it causes a lot of stress as we go over and over the same thoughts, bringing few solutions.  We have to find the power to stop our minds going over the old and create new ways of thinking.  Our minds belong to us and so we should have control over our thoughts, our thoughts are connected to our feelings, so once we are able to change our thoughts for more positive, constructive thoughts we will begin to feel better and be less stressed.  Meditation helps us understand who we are, where our thoughts come from and how to re-direct those thoughts to create better outcomes.  If you are interested in learning meditation or, perhaps to start with positive thinking, the suggestion would be to visit your local BK center, where these causes are taught regularly.  If you live in India you can find your local bk center by visiting brahmakumaris.org or for centers worldwide visit bkwsu.org (this website). for further details.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Nice message in today's world everyone is searching for happiness but happiness is our original quality, we do not need to search it out side. It is just one thought away, when I think I am a child of Supreme Father I find my self filling with His powers and virtues, through this we can serve others. Om shanti to all.]]></description>
