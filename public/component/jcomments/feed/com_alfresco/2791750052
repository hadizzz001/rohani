			<description><![CDATA[Adi:  We do choose our destiny by the actions we take, for this life and the next.  God is our spiritual Parent, Teacher and Guide.  Since God is the Truth, altruistic and filled with all qualitys of wisdom, love, peace happiness etc. then by connecting to him through meditation, (Yoga) we draw these qualities from God so that we can use these qualities and Gods power in our lives to make better choices and bring about the change we need individually and in the world.  This is our Godly Inheritnace.  We, actually do not worship God but as God's children we have a lot of love, respect and faith in our unlimited Parent, and remember 'Him' and this creates a deep and unlimited bond. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dear Dadi,There is one question that always perplexes me. It is believed that before we are born we choose our own lives in the spiritual world that we plan to lead while on earth. Then it is believed that we are the creators of our own destiny on earth, we have to take actions in life that help us grow, the spiritual world or God does not intefere. If we land in a mess it is because of our doing. If I have to choose my life in the spiritual world, if I have to make sure that I dont land in a soup with my life on earth. I am doing everythng. Then what is God for? Why should I worship him?]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Omshanti...Thanks Dadi JI, your messages are enlightening. Daily introspection and filling the self- accountability chart of “How much happiness did I have today, and how much sorrow did I have today?” really improves the happiness for the next day...]]></description>

Recently after doing Rajyoga meditation course from one of your centre I came to know that I am only responsible for my happiness and sorrows.

			<description><![CDATA[Dear Dadi Ji, This is well said. Most of the time we look for the external sources for happiness rather than remaining content with what we have and what is prevailing and this throws us into another mess. Also not accepting the situation as it is causes lot of pains and we make wasteful efforts to change or circumvent the situations that are not possible to change and this again leads to frustration.Thanks for this valuable advice and highly useful guidance.Om Shanti! ]]></description>
