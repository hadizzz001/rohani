			<description><![CDATA[Rita Bajaj:  There is no difference between a male and a female soul.  The soul has no gender it is a non physical point of life energy.  The actions we perform will definitely impact the soul - we receive the fruit of our karma's, whether good or bad,  Elevated actions will bring elevated fruit and degraded actions will bring degradation, it is the same whether one is male or female.]]></description>
