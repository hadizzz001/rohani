			<description><![CDATA[To experience peace, power and happiness all the time we must pay constant attention to the mind. When the mind is peaceful, we can make the energy of love flow and also have access to our inner wisdom. As soon as the mind becomes agitated, we lose our connection to love and wisdom, and therefore happiness. The first step is to sit quietly and connect with the inner place of peace. From that place, open your awareness to God and feel the flow of God’s pure love. The next step, which is more challenging, is to keep remembering God’s love while you go through your day’s activities. This will keep the mind peaceful and stable, and give you power and happiness throughout the day.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[The surrendered brothers in Madhuban first attend one of the BK centres in India. They study Raja Yoga, adopt a spiritual lifestyle, and do service from their centers. In their centers, they undergo various trainings. To surrender in Madhuban is a decision that would be made by the kumar, his teacher and the main instrument at his center. Surrender is a lifelong commitment and so it takes time and effort to come to that decision. The first step would be to study at your local BK centre.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[First of all, I like to thank the entire Brahma Kumari organization for the wonderful thoughts that is being shared by All Dadis / Brahma Kumar's & Brahma Kumari's through spiritual programme at Peace Of Mind Channel. By following awakening programe of Sister Shivani's and Channel, I could come with lot of desired change within myself and shall continue further too. I would like to learn Raj Yoga Meditation and for that I could't make to BK Centre due to my own constraint. But sometime in future, I would like to do the same if possible in BK HQ, I will be very much grateful. OM SHANTI]]></description>
