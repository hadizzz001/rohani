			<description><![CDATA[Feelings. Life is spent and revovles around feelings. It is very difficult to separate feelings from the loved ones and that is what causes the negative thoughts. Only way to eliminate feelings is to become the living dead(no feelings) with the very people whom you have brought to this world(children) and that is very difficult. Life is a balance between care and share with feelings and how do you eliminate feelings without disowning the very loved. Maybe God has a message that if you love, love me and no-one else. So why get married and have family when ultimately you will disown them.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Sonalika: We can remember God when we are in meditaion.  This is the best way as we are focused and abosorbed without distractions.  However, we can also remember God while walking and moving around, like with any relationship, we remember the one we love and the qualities and the feelings that are connected with that one emerge.  In order to receive power from rememberance however, it is necessary to be soul councious, that is to be in the awareness of being a soul, as God too is a soul - the Supreme Soul. So by being soul concious you are aligning yourself with God - you are getting on the same 'wave length' and are able to receive - like tuning in to a radio station.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Gud evening... By staying in God's rememberence we can fill ourselves with power that is required to change us in positive way or shifts our mind from bad to good things but i want an answer to the question that how we could rather I could remember God all the time? Is it through meditation?or there are some other ways and means? If somebody can answer me,please do me a favour. I'll be grateful to you..]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Suswan,  As with all worthwhile things, they take time to cultivate.  Meditation is a practice which is better when done regularly for short periods building the time spent daily.  As with any practice, we need to be consistant and focused.  In meditation our aim is to spend time with ourselves and with God.  This relationship also needs to be 'built'.  God is always available, filled with the qualities of love, peace, happiness and truth.  God is always sharing these qualities with us - to give us power - we have to get onto the same 'wave-length' as God - become aware of ourselves as a soul, a spiritual being, light energy - and then we will be able to receive these qualities and powers from God and experience Gods company.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Jumu: The soul is like an actor who plays its part through its physical costume (body) on this stage (the earth).  The mind is part of the soul.  The mind is a very subtle and powerful energy, and works in many ways. One way is as the creator. Our thoughts do transmit powerful creative energy that when focussed and concentrated, can manifest in the physical world. Another way is the mind 'picks up' what is going to happen in the future. We call this intuition. The answer is not really either this or that. Both can happen at the same time.  ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hemakrihnan:  When Dadi speakes of the 'heart' here she is speaking about the heart meaning where feelings come from, not literally the physical heart.  We often describe our feelings as connected to 'our heart' but what we mean is that we are experiencing these feelings and our experiences come from our soul.  The mind of which thoughts and feelings are a part, are in the soul and these get expressed through our physical bodies and brought into the world. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Sunil: Through remembrance of God, who is the unlimited source of happiness, we can receive happiness.  However, like any relationship it takes time to build and nurture.  God has many qualities and as we get closer and spend more time with God so the qualities God influence us.  In today's society, we crave for instant gratification, and think that it will bring us happiness but it is very limited and fleeting, and we then become disappointed.  This is the world of forgetting and remembering - the more you remember God the happier you will be and when you forget, and get distracted by limited things inevitably happiness is short lived. Constant attention and remembrance of our True Friend brings constant happiness.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Mansi:  When we allow ourselves to feel overwhelmed by something, for example our studies, we will not be able to concentrate, as our mind fills with worry instead of focusing on what is in front of us.  Habits are created by repetition, perhaps by re-reading the message from Dadi the understanding that by remembering God the cycle of worry has an opportunity to break and you also receive power from that remembrance.  Also organizing your study time into manageable segments will also help to reduce the worry.  Worry wastes a lot of time and can lead to depression.]]></description>
