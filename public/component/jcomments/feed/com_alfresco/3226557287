			<description><![CDATA[In order to fulfill our dreams, we need a constant and reliable source of power and inspiration. We need to both be able to ‘charge our spiritual batteries’ and take pure power from the Supreme Soul. Both of these are done through Raja Yoga meditation. The soul connects with its highest vision of the self and find the inner resources to work towards realising that vision. The soul also connects with the Supreme Soul, who is the loving Father of all human souls, and takes guidance and inspiration. You can learn Raja Yoga meditation at any Brahma Kumaris centre.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[You are quite clear that you want your future to be different from your past. To accomplish this, you would need to look at your life and your world in completely different ways. In Raja Yoga, we see ourselves and other people as souls, eternal beings of light and children of God. We strive to behave like children of God and treat other people as we would treat God’s children. This leads to a different kind of relationship – a spiritual relationship. Even if people we have known for a long time come in front of us, we don’t see them in the same old way. We now see them as souls and children of God. What we say to them and how we feel about them is now very different – our thoughts and feelings are spiritual. The people therefore respond to us in different ways. The old relationship is over. New spiritual relationships are created. This is how we change our karma.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Health problems need to be first addressed by medical and mental health professionals. After a treatment plan is in place, Raja Yoga can help with managing the thoughts and keeping the mind peaceful. Raja Yoga is intended for life-long spiritual development leading to peace and happiness through daily spiritual practice. It is not a “fix” for physical, mental or emotional difficultie]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Your local center where you listen to murli can work with you to help you meet the guidelines for visiting Madhuban. In general, BK students who go to Madhuban are given many classes by senior teachers and opportunities for guided yoga. Any personal issues that you have would best be worked out through your local center before visiting Madhuban. This way, you can take the maximum benefit from Madhuban.]]></description>
