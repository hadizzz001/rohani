			<description><![CDATA[It takes a lot of patience and perseverance to stick with an exam for two years. It seems like you have all the knowledge, but one little thing is missing. Perhaps that thing is attitude. Is it actually true that you are in ‘bad days’ and you can only come out if and when you pass the exam? Do you ever have good days? If you do, then ‘good days’ have nothing to do with the exam. Each day, look at the potential for joy, peace, helping and learning. Make this the basis of a ‘good day’. Prepare for the exam by practicing a still and peaceful state of mind. Remember that the exam has nothing to do with your self-worth – it has to do with information about the outside world. Give yourself love and respect. When you take the exam, have only the desire to give it your best. Know that sooner or later you will definitely pass!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I am trying to crack an exam from past 2 yrs but nt able to do it. Its like i know all the possible methods, have studied all the concepts, logics, everything but nothing works. My self confidence has become almost null or in negative. This exam is a key to come out of my bad days. I would be glad if you would talk to me and guide me for a few minutes.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[The Power to withdraw is to go inside yourself, the soul, and realise all your qualities, that of love, peace and wisdom, purity and happiness before going into any action. Then as we perform actions in the physical world, we can put these qualities into eveything we do. This way we are always able to give our best.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Withdrawing, is it power or weakness? If it is power, what type of qualities we have to inculcate to acquire that power? I feel it is necessary to concentrate in this discussion.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[The power of the soul is it's quality. The original quality of the soul is love, peace, happiness, purity and wisdom. When we can connect to our own qualities we become full of power or powerful. Meditation helps us to remember our quality.]]></description>
