			<description><![CDATA[Prachi: With a generous heart it is always good to forgive.  If you truely forgive you heal yourself also. Everyone makes mistakes.  However, be sensible, use your wisdom to see what is real.  Listen to your own heart and concience in front of God and you will know what is right.  Other people are your brothers and can only advise according to their capacity.  Listen to God who is the truth and connect to your own truth.  ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Namaste,I have a friend who cheated me in some matter between us. He/she explained that he/she didn't ask me the truth to save the friendship. The matter was serious & which has broken my trust. But still I feel that I should forgive him/her & give one more chance to our friendship....... I forgave him/her for the mistake & behaving normally as before with him/her. My friend was with me in bad days of my life & i have spend lots of good moments with him/her. But everybody is advising me that whatever i have done is wrong & i should not give him/her another chance. please guide me.]]></description>
