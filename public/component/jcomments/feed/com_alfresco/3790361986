			<description><![CDATA[Nalini:  It can indeed be very frustrating in a noisy atmosphere where you cannot hear yourself think! Perhpas you could talk to your employers about the situation to see if there is a way that all of you would beneift from some layout or structual changes to the office.  Happy and calm employees will produce better work.  Also, internally if you prepare yourself before going to the office to be peacful, you could then perhaps respectfully speak with your collegues about the benefit for all if voices are kept down.  If noise persists then your practice will help you not to get irrittated in the moment. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om Shanti. In today's world, many of us are so easily offended by what others say. This is because we are not taking the time to really listen and think about the message being conveyed; instead ego sets in and we immediately react to what is being said. We all need to acquire the inner silence of which Dadi is speaking so as not to be so reactive.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om Shanti,I have a question.When for example it is tooo noisy in the office and i'm on the phone. I can hardly hear the other person and myself. This happens very often. I get irritated and when i ask for some silence the tone that comes out is not good. How to change/act at that time? And how to correct the mistake?Love,Nalini]]></description>
