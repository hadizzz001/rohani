			<description><![CDATA[Rads:  Since you have not said what the problem is, it is not possible to advise you.  We only offer advise on spiritual matters.   Take time to quite your mind from too many thoughts, so that you can think more clearly, take it step by step.  If you want to learn meditation, perhpas you would like to go to a BK meditations center.  Meditation helps with the power of discernment.  If your problem is serious, getting advise from a proffessional may help. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Amit Bhaduri:  Spirituality is reflected in our behaviour, it is not a philosopy.  How do I treat myslef, my life, others, nature, my inner world etc.  When spiritual knowledge is practiced consistantly, it becomes a natural part of our lives and we gain the strength to be stable, and in so doing bring peace, love, patience, contentment to ourselves, our families, comunities and the world.  There is a lot of chaos due to the lack of these spiritual qualities and virtues. Whatever anyone else is doing, what is it that I want to do.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[thank you dadi for this great message.Infact when we practice being in present we forget about worry of past and fear of future.worry and fear cause drainage of energy.so when we face any problem we start feeling energyless.Being in the present saves this unnesesary energy loss and this conserved enery help us ovecome any odd situation.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[dear Dadi,Since i started watching PEACE OF MIND at 10.30 pm every night, i feel greatly relieved and at peace. I am trying my best to follow the teachings of brahmakumaris.However I have one question - is it not a lot easy to practise all that you teach by living in an environment where each day is same as another and among people who share the same ideas, belief and goal.Wheareas much as i would love to live life the way you preach but the daily conforntation with events in the real world which are never same often reduces me to despair and ponder.How do i remain calm in this chaos.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dear Dadiji - your messages and awakening with Brahma kumaris which I watch on TV have really helped me to change myself and that is really proving to be very good for me. Now whenever I start thinking of my past which was not so pleasant immediately I tell myself to divert my mind to the present or think of something which delights me. Initially it was difficult but gradually it is becoming a habbit and able to change my thoughts fast. In extreme cases it takes some time to change the thoghts but still very good compared to what it was before. advice to all - do practice.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dadiji this is a wonderful message. The day I practice not being getting disturbed by the past, I feel lot of energy in me and the productivity increases. Every one of has some bad memories of the past which at times keep haunting us and do affect our relationships and behaviour in the present. At times it is difficult to get rid of those memories and worries, but reading your message, gives us enough determination to practice that. Keep guiding us thru as your spiritual messages are quite valuable for us in terms of keeping ourselves on the right path. OS.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dear BK Janki, I fully agree with what you said, but...There is one thing we have to take count of. What for me now is present, for example, is that i am now aware of what i am doing. But, lets say in 3 or 4 hours, someone ask me something about what i have been doing. I could tell him/her what ive done, even more important is, the other one would really like to know. So, there i am, in lets say 3,5 hours, telling another friend of my that i was typing a comment on the internet at 13.47 h. And then i think we reach Einsteins matter, is time really relative? With love.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Thaks dadi for the wonderful message.the day I don't read your message I feel I have lost gods message for.i always go by your messages. past is past, whatever lament we will do it will not come, future is unknown. so we should always be on baba s shrimat and forget all the bad and nasty things that had caused one intense grief. the only thing which is valuable is our present moment.so we should make the best use of it, going through brhma baba s life unfolding book has given me a lot of inspiration how to be a suchha yogi.]]></description>
