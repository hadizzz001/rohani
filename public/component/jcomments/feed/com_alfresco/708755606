			<description><![CDATA[Morgan: Perhaps you would like to see the response given to Paritosh  Humility definitely comes from being introverted because when you are introverted you come from the understanding that you are a spiritual being, a being of peace, and you recognize others as such, and respond to them accordingly and so do not respond with false ego, or to false identity; such as position, nationality, status etc.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Richa:  Yes, to be introverted takes practice, the world today is so extroverted - thinking that happiness is derived from outside of us, and thus the continual search and dissatisfaction. Once we realize that peace and happiness lie within us, in fact it is our original nature, our relationship with ourselves and with others change, our whole world view changes, and there is contentment.  You will hear the Brahma Kumaris often say 'om shanti'  this means that 'I am a peaceful soul - not that I have peace - but I am peace.  It is worth the effort to remember this. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Paritosh:  I can understandthat this may seem confusing.  Beingintroverted doesn’t mean to be shy and withdrawn and not to interact withpeople.  It means to respond with a senseof internal peace; to interact with love recognizing the other to be aspiritual being.   Seeing what it is thatconnects us as a “brotherhood” rather than what appears to separate usexternally, such as gender, race position etc. Hope this helps.  ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Thank you for your inspiration to so many souls me included. I personally find keeping my mind introverted gives me such inner peace and balance, so all that all I do in the physical world becomes so effortless and light.  Staying in remembrance of the one Father makes life's journey simple and easy. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om shanti. This is my first time I am writing to you. One of my friends told me about Brahma Kumaris and thereafter I started to read contents this web site. I live in stoke-on-Trent, UK working in NHS as an Occupational therapist. Everybody says that I am introvert and everyone suggests to me that I should be more extrovert, I should interact more. And my job also requires me to be extrovert. But according to you I should be introvert, which is bit confusing for me.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[by following what has been said in this msg, staying in the remembrance of the Father, remembering only him, i personally feel that u are able to focus on what you are doing, live in the present, become more careful. i love the feeling that i get, when i only remember the one father, there is so much of love, happiness. i just feel happy whenever i remember him. like there there is a flow of peace in me. The Father says that any attachment towards bodily beings is damaging, why should we have such attachment, when at the end of the day this only brings suffering.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om Shanti,Thank you for the beautiful article. It was a really nice read. But these days, when you spend most of the time in work environment, you are judged by how you interact with the people around you, or how you use your 'interpersonal skills'. In short, the world wants you to be more extroverted. How do I balance?]]></description>
