			<description><![CDATA[uttama:  These men loose their own honor by behaving in this way.  Perhaps you could try two things: If it persists and you feel uncomfortable report them to your superiors.  Disasociate yourself from their behavior, if they don't get a response from you they may tire of their bad behavior as they will see that it is not affecting you.   The important thing is to hold onto your self respect, don't get angry, they are diminished by this behavior, and you by holding onto your peace are the one who is gaining strength. ]]></description>
