			<description><![CDATA[Deepshika.  We cannotcontrol others but we do have a choice of how to respond to them.  We do not have to take what others offer us; forexample if someone was giving you a bad apple, would you take it? You do not haveto accept it.  In fact you could evenoffer them a fresh apple in return as they do not seem to have one.  In other words, they are lacking somethingwhich is why they are discontent, so offer them something good; a kind word,smile with some good wishes.  Sharingbrings a lot of happiness to the self and others.]]></description>
