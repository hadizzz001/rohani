			<title>RE: If we are detached, we can develop a loving nature</title>

			<description><![CDATA[Nisha:  When we understand that nothing belongs to us, we are souls and as such we came here with nothing and will return with nothing (physical). If we interact with love and detachment then we experience happiness in our relationships, in our interaction with matter.  We often say that God has given us everything, but when God 'takes things from us' we feel pain - but actually God would never cause sorrow.  We are trustees of everything and as such we care for those things, people, nature but we do not become attached to it considering it to be ours.  So with this subtle understanding we will not be so likely to get attached and therefore feel sorrow when it is gone. If we get ourselves tied to someone or something -  when that pulls we have no option but to go in that direction - we are in bondage.  But if we are in relationship to someone or something it is more like a dance - they dance their steps (in and out, back and forth, round and round) and we dance ours  - in partnership - it becomes a dance of harmony and there is joy, beauty and happiness in that dance.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much for this great message!But please tell me how to get back to the state of detachment, when we feel the pain of attachment. Because only when the pain starts, we are realising that we are attached to it. Kindly tell us more about this.Nisha]]></description>
