			<description><![CDATA[Binay Kumar: Thinking ill of someone doesn't benefit the self or transform the other for the better. If we want to bring change to a situation the best way is to change our own attitude and be an example - have understanding, good wishes and give encouragement.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Until last year I used to think that I was a positive thinker. Nevertheless, every time things used to go awry. I was not happy at all with my life. But last year one of my friends took me to BK Godly University, Guwahati. Thence I came to know that the culprit of my unhappiness was my own thinking. Then I took a course there   I started changing my thinking pattern. And now I'm happier than the happiest. Thanks to Baba   the Behenjis in BK, Guwahati, whoever have bestowed this eternal peace   bliss upon me. :-)]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Message is short but very meaningful. Our karma and thoughts have same effect. Like good karmas bring good result for us in the same way good thinking also brings good result for us. Always watch your thoughts. In case you feel you are having negative thoughts it may be for you or for any other person just change it immediately and force yourself to create positive thoughts which will help you to make your future destiny positive. Always watch your karmas and thoughts and ensure that they are towards postive direction.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Thinking and karma are inter-related.thinking too is a karma , it could be either in the positive or negative direction.even if we hurt someone in our thoughts it is purely negative. This is the first step towards deterioration of personality.in the second step that wrong thought is performed in action, leading to apparent loss to the person concerned.similarly good thoughts and good actions spread fraternity, compassion and spirituality.this leads to divinity.O dear brothers and sisters let us all spread the heavenly feeling of love and compassion both in thoughts and deeds .Om shanti........]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[When someone has hurt us we waste so much time thinking about it. We play the record over and over in our minds. I agree it is a total waste of energy and brings no benefit.By replaying it does not change anything. We need to put a full stop and use our mind in a worthwhile way creating benefit for ourself and others.]]></description>
