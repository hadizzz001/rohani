			<description><![CDATA[Thanks till today we are not able to think how one feels in the presence of God.Until now we had read about God in the form of deities and we had been them as Durga and Kali and others, but we have forgotten that we are those same souls the soul having taking its part from satyug to kaliyug. The soul completely lost all its purity and power so God has come at this time to make us remember who we are and what is our sacred role. Now we can connect to God only through pure sankalps and deep meditation thanks Dadiji you have helped us in this sacred search for God.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om Shanti.It was somewhat difficult for me to do early morning meditation (Amritvela). After attending SPARC Conference September 2010, I started to awake early in the morning and with the help of commentary by BK Surajbhai, I am now feeling always attached (close) with God (Baba). It is so peaceful and satisfactory, I think every one must experience these divine feelings.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Good morning Dadiji.  Actually we have still not felt the feeling of being with God. Now we have understood that only when we are in self conscious state then only we can get the blessing of God, mere reading does not yield all these our purana belief systems and sanskars are so strong and sometimes they make us so week that we become cages in our own self made caves. Dadiji its your yogic power and pure love for God that you are so joined to God (Baba), for us we are in a nursery classroom, but faith is still there because Rome was not built in a day!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Kanchan:  We experience Gods's love when we experience ourselves to be God's child, a soul, a being pure being of light.  In this soul conscious awareness we leave aside the things of the world and focus only on God, who is also a soul - the Supreme Soul.  As we elevate our consciousness we are able to get on the same wave-length and experience Gods's love.  This is our relationship with our Parent and so we do not need Dadi to join us - this is between us and God.  Dadi of course sends good wishes to all souls to experience God's love, but the connection has to happen through our own effort and as Dadi is saying we need to clean our minds so that we can attract God, so we should have no waste or negative thoughts that will block this experience.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Good morning dadiji. The mere felling of being with god gives a super sensuous feeling. Why do we see upwards and call for almighty God when all our things go topsy-turvy, its your power and blessings dadiji which give us inspiration through the day. Yes whenever a utensil is very dirty first we have to clean it and then only we can fill it with amrit (nectar), the same thing Dadi you have also told us we should keep our mind free from impure thoughts then only we can experience the deep feelings of being with God.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[this is what i was searching for my dear dadi. we do not know how we should feel in the company of god. by mere feeling with near and dear ones with whom we share a lot of similar things we feel good, so the same thing dadi has also said how to make our heart clear in order to be with god. dadi this message is able to change the lives of thousands and thousands of God's children.]]></description>
