			<description><![CDATA[Kritika and Anshu:  It can sometimes be chanllenging to find a quite space to meditate.  However you could practice what we call 'traffic contol' which is to take a few minutes out of your day every hour and pull your mind away from what you are doing.  Still your mind  in the awareness of being a peaceful being of light and a child of God, brining your mind into a state of peace.  You will find that you will often go back to whatever you were doing with a different attitude and perspective  If you continue to practice this regularly your mind will be come peaceful and you will strengthen your capacity for concentration and wasteful and useless thoughts will reduce.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Good morning dadiji. First take my heartiest wish for rakha bandhan..Yes dadiji todays demand is only peace. We all have become so peacleless outside and inside that sometimes there comes a hollow felling. For outside peace to come, first inside we have to be at peace, we have to be soul conscious, then only we can do anything for others, previously my belief system was very wrong, I thought peace was something rare.]]></description>
