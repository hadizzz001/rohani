From now on, shiv Baba will look after it, and I am free!! I am very happy now!!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om Shanti,I am always in awe of how simple Dadi's words are yet how deep the message. I often hear people saying "I believe in God" or "I have full faith in God"; yet, in the next breath they talk about their worries/burdens not realizing that they are contradicting their faith in God. One of the very first lessons I learnt from Haidar Medlej is "everything is and will be fine" so there is no place for worry. I am today a much lighter and enlightened being than I was a couple years ago thanks to the teachings of Dadi and the BK organisation. Thank you]]></description>
