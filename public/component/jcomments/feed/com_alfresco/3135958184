			<description><![CDATA[Pratima:  Only you can decide what is the truth for you.  It is important to keep the company of truth in life.  So perhaps you could continue learning Raj Yoga, and then once you feel you have given yourself time to understand, you will know what you must do. Om shanti.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Pusrushothama:  It is human beings who have created this society on the basis of their thoughts words and actions.  Human beings have forgotten how to be their true selves and are mainly focused on physical gain - to fill themselves up -  because there is a deep feeling of loss of truth.  God is Truth.  If we want to see a better world then it is important to understand the self and to connect to the Source of Truth, Love and Peace - God.  It is only then that we can bring these qualities back to the world - and be able to 'see' God.  Meditation is a practice that can help you to know your true self and know God.  Through this you develope your 'seeing' or 'knowing' capacity.  Not physically - as God is not a physical being - but a non-physical being of light.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Pooja:  To forget someone we first have to remember ourselves.  This can be done through meditation.  Through meditation we also learn how to direct our thoughts in the way that we want them to go.  We strenthen our intellects and determination, so that our thoughts and feelings follow our directions and it becomes easier to make good choices.]]></description>
