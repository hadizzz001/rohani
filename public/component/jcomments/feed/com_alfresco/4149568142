			<description><![CDATA[Rina, when ever we start something there is always a lot of improvement to begin with and we notice the change because we are bringing something new and fresh into our lives and the practice of meditation and spiritual knowledge brings a big change because we begin to think and act differently. The magic wand is really practice and staying power.  Constancy is very important and brings its own reward.  ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I am a member of the BK family for more than a year.  Practicing to remain in peace and in soul conciousness appears very simple . I try to implement the contents of the morning class in that perticular days routine. It has brought a lot of change in the things happening around me. But I feel the transformation is still 10% and the growth has stagnated . Dadi please give me a magic wand which helps me proceed furthert. I am very desperate to grow.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Saroj:  Like any practice, being in soul consciousness takes attention.  The more we put it into practice the easier it becomes.  Our minds easily get distracted and drawn into physical things and situations.  We just have to bring ourselves back to the awareness of who we truly are, a peaceful soul again and again.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Thanks Dadiji It is very painful time now, but the awareness of being a peaceful soul takes us to the beautiful world of peace. But to stick to it whole day in this material world is quite difficult. Please give us a simpler way how to be always detached from worldly affairs and be in the state of soul consciousness.]]></description>
