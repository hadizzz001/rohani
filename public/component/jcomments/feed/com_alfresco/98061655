			<description><![CDATA[Dhavala Suri:  By understanding that we are ultimately master of our own minds.  The past is the past, dwelling on it brings it into the present and prevents us from moving forward.  Understanding that we are peaceful souls and practicing this experience in meditation will bring the power we need to put things behind us.  Meditation focuses our minds on the present, leaving behind all concerns that we are caught up in.  The time spent in this experience of peace, impacts the soul, allowing us to become more subtle and to connect with our true innate qualities, in this stage we are able to draw power from God also, this stage of meditation purifies the soul, allowing us to let go of past influences. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Like many others, I always wanted to believe in magic. I enjoyed books in which heroes used magic to make great things happen. However, I noticed that, although they sometimes did amazing things, their lives were often miserable. So I never really believed that magic had a place in my life]]></description>
