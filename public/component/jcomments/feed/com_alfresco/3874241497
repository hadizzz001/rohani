			<description><![CDATA[God doesn't take anyone from anyone . . . each soul has its own part and when the time comes for them to move on . . . they will.  Your deep love for them will help them by sending them good wishes and pure thoughts for their new journey.  You also have your own part and journey, it is natural to miss your family members you will help yourself and them by moving forward.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Today is the first day , i saw a Brahma Kumaris program on star world in Dubai.i was really attracted by the comments on how to close the account of your past life & start a new future. I have gone angioplasty surgery few weeks back. I was always pondering about my past, at the age of 39 years i have helped so many people in many many ways. what wrong i have done etc ........ what a time to hear this program. I got most of my answers. Yes, the root of all sufferings are in our things of past. Its better to start a new chapter in life........Thank you. Om Shanti.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Achieving an elevated thought is towards positive construction is in itself "peace", forgetting, erasing past negative thoughts experiences from the mind, and focusing on the present, of what can be done in the present . . . forgetting bad experiences with people and instead make them opportunities to learn about people and make them as stepping stones towards a better life . . . and focusing on what could be done of the present is a "card of opportunites at hand" to grow in wisdom like a tree with patience/tolerance, and the power of acceptence, like the ocean with the incoming flow of its rivers. gbua]]></description>
