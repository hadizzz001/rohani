			<description><![CDATA[Yes, our dearly Dadi is right. Simplicity is a priceless quality which can come to us when we create peaceful, pure and positive thoughts only at all times. The highest practice is to create positive thoughts, say positive words and do positive deeds at every moment. Life is short, let us add value to our life and that of others before we ascend. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om Shanti Dadi ji... This message is so profound... Yes in truth most of us are waiting for life, that something will happen tomorrow... something better is yet to come ... and in this waiting we miss life... we miss moments... and we miss purpose... May be one day we will realise the real meaning. and dear Dadi you are making us to realise through your messages. Thank you...]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Thanks dadiji for the enlightened message.we should be hopeful always.because without hope life is impossible.i don't say we can't live or sleep but hope comes for being our of our own rcognition of who we are and what is the real being.there should always be a separation of the real and falsehood.even sometime we don't know what is our real self but in order to make others happy we start to show a different face which is very bad.after that the whole of our days and nights feel with repentance.so to free from falsehood we should always have to meditate throught the dayanew night. Om shantie]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Really appreciate this That It is important to act and not just talk.Most of us just waste our energy thinking rather than implementing.We will think good but in adverse circumstances we become the same as before. Reading Dadi Janki everyday helps a lot.]]></description>
