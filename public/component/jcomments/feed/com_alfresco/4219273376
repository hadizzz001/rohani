			<description><![CDATA[Mala Nayer:  Knowedge is one thing but putting somthing into practice takes determination.  Our negative thoughts and feelings have become very prevalent in the soul because they are habit forming and therefore it takes persistance to change them, but once you are able to change your feelings then your thoughts will follow.  We often spend a lot of time thinking about what others are doing -- what they should or should not be doing.  But this is wasteful and negative since there is nothing we can do about how others behave, but we can change our own response to things and protect ourselves from negativity by keeping our own self-respect.  It is helpful to spend time observing our own thought patterns, the familiar 'stories' we keep telling ourselves in our minds, these are our deep habits that can bring us sorrow, even though we may not have the concious intention of thinking in these ways, we always seem to go back to them.  One tool to help is as soon as you feel the same old story emerging in your mind, put a 'full stop' and remember these are aquired habits that you do not need, they are not you, you have created them and you can change them.  Fill your mind with thoughts of who you really are and what your qualities are.  Connect to God, and fill your self with Gods's qualities and strength, experience the Company of Truth and this will give you the power to change your feelings.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dear Moderator :My question - When I am very upset I can feel the negative thoughts I am having are not good for me at all. I try to change it but the negative emotions are so strong that it takes quite some time to come out of it in spite of knowing and trying hard to get out of it. Is there any way which can help us to change the the negative feelings immediately because I know now by reading these messages that negative feelings attract negative things which I want to avoid conciously. Please help.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Amy, it is good that you are making effort to change the way you think and to let go of the past.  Some things are deeply imbeded in the soul and take time to change, but with patience, practice, and determination there will be success.  Keep courage and there will be change.  Learning to meditate will help a lot.  You may want to go to one of the BK centers near you to learn this also being in the company of others with the same aims also help.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dadi On shanthi. It is really true. If everyone adopt this kind of thinking then there will be no bad events will happen in society. All can become super human beings. Even i get distrecred by waste toughts and negative thoughts. But later i will realize it was absolutely waste. If u dont have any work means all waste thoughts will run in our mind. Let us remember the god if our mind is free from all work. Dont allow devils to enter into our minds. Waste and negative thoughts are devil.Let us keep in mind the words of daddi and practice and see the difference in ourself.]]></description>

So true...it's a game of thoughts and because of it sometimes we feel lethargic. we just to understand and need to focus on our thoughts. sometimes without any specific reason we feel depressed and feel nothing is there but if we can work on our thoughts and generate positive thinking then everything will be so easy for us.]]></description>
