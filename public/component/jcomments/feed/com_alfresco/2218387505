			<description><![CDATA[Think your thoughts, watch your thoughts, words and deeds. Watch what you want to say or do before you say or do them. Check by asking yourself within- Are my words and actions pure? before you release your words and actions. When your mind thinks and creates so much thought, its a sign that you are thinking negatively? Slow your thoughts by watching them. What will happen will happen, so why think much?]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Karim, It can be difficult not to get affected by the degradation and sorrow of the world.  However the only way we are going to be of help to ourselves and others is to focus on creating a new and better way.  Empowering ourselves and connecting to the source of Truth and Love - God - enables us to share what we receive with the rest of our human family. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Thank you God for putting in my way to BK back in 2005. I see the world is "dying", it is the only way to be born again I suppose. I would like to know more details about how we should face this degradation without becoming negative or depressed. Thank you.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I was 8 years of age when out of curosity, while playing with friends, I accidentally, or out of curiosity and fun just happened to sneak into a small BK temple in Malviya Nagar then. A spirited BK escorted me to various charts explaining the concept which only strengthened what vague memories were imbibed on my child mind from my Granny ( Dadi's) Bed time stories. I realized this much later that those 15 minutes of playful fun somehow shaped my orientation towards life and sprinkled a few seeds of Spirituality for which I feel thankful and do not regret!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Priya: God the Supreme Soul (Paramatama) is a being of light.  We as God's children are also beings of light (souls). We come into the cycle of life; - into the physical world, and so we have to take a body to experinence life through our senses.  We are a soul who has a body.  God doesn't take a body of his own and is therefore remains beyound this physical world and resides in Paramdahmam.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Thanks to Dadi Ji for this motivating thought. The cause of worry in life is due to body consciousness. Body consciousness is due to attachment of the soul with body. To remove body consciousness, we have to practice the detachment of soul with body i.e. Ashariri stage, then practice soul consciousness. Then connect the soul to supreme soul to experience peace, love and power. In this way, we become stable in mind and our intellect become pure and powerful. We become stable and powerful to choose our proper responses in every situations and become free from worry and concern. Om Shanti.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[carefree emperor?... for me, those words do not jive to having strong faith in God... coz we do care and we do not wish to be emperors which is synanimous with materialism. But perhaps we are happy peaceful angels who could fly, holding each other, thru peace, smiling and cheering with positive thoughts armed with faith in our GOD almighty. thank you Dadi Janki... our angel of wisdom]]></description>
