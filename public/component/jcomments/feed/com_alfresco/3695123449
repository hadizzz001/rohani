			<description><![CDATA[Komal Grover:  Thank you for your comments thisis quite a common aspect of human nature and we have responded to thisbefore.  Perhaps you would like to lookat some of the postings. Expectations can never be fulfilled, whenever youexpect something from someone try at that moment to accept them as they are,remember everyone is unique and may not think in the same way as you – changeexpecting into accepting. If you do it, this practice will bring you a lot ofcontentment.   ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Indervir Kaur,As you say it is very easy to speak, however, power comesfrom following what it is that we say. For this we need understanding, practice, and commitment.  If our aim is to be peaceful, then we need tothink about what it feels like to be peaceful and how can we attain this stateof being; what do we need to do to accomplish it? Perhaps you could try thisexercise:  First thing in the morning,give yourself an aim – today I am going to experience myself as a peacefulbeing.  Keep this aim with you as you goabout your day.  At the end of the dayspend a little time in reflection and see how much you were able to dothis.  Recognize even the smallestaccomplishment and build on it the following day, and the day after . . . Don’t lose hope in yourself, you are Gods child, God is hereto help, as you remember God feel His/Her love, support, and power.  There is extra power when we do things assoon as we think about them.  Try thisexercise now and see the result.  ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Manvi Verma, an answer to your question:With practice . . .and with understanding.  The only person we can change is ourselves.  By focusing on ourselves and, as Dadi says, byspending time in solitude and silence our “inner smile” will develop and ourfocus will be drawn away from judging others, naturally.  When we find this difficult, we can connect to ourpowerful Friend, God.  He is always thereto help, and in silence we hear.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[This is, indeed, a message that can help the heart to explore the very purpose of human existence. i.e., LOVE ALL AND SERVE ALL, not just in theory, but in practice. It will help man explore beyond the traditional horizon where peace, serenity and divinity resides. That is the abode of THE ALMIGHTY. It is no where else, but within our self. With Love]]></description>
