			<description><![CDATA[Neil, the spiritual powers mentioned in this series of articles are complementary and are meant to be used in a balanced way and as appropriate. Sometimes it is necessary to tolerate, and at other times to face. This article was addressing the power of cooperation, which really requires proficiency in wisely using all the other powers. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this thought provoking article. Darwin's theory of evolution does go to some way to explain why humans cooperate and are philanthropic in nature. However, I would like you to comment further on the points you raise in paragraph two. Specifically, the tendency of the mind to create egocentric stories. If one is giving lovingly with good thoughts and is making one happy. However, the recipient is taking advantage of one's generosity to the point where they are beginning to exploit one, should one continue to give infinitely? i.e should we 'tolerate or face'? as discussed in another article?]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[A very nice article indeed. "Nature doesn't waste its energy on precious thoughts". I like that concept a lot. The 100th monkey story never actually happened so I wouldn't use that but the essence of synergy of minds working together is certainly a truth I believe in. Dan]]></description>
