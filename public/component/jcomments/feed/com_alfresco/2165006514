			<description><![CDATA[Dear moderator, when we transform the world will transform. We should not change people but we can change our mindset and ourselves.Lets take an example of a childs upbringing at home. Now a days everyone is depleted inside. Children are the most unfortunate one if they cant find the good environment at home. Parents are doing a lot of torture either knowingly or unknowingly to their children both on mental as well as physical level.because of these hindrances we are loosing peaceful indivisuals on this earth. These are the main reasons for suicide of young indivisuals.How can we bring an awareness?]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Transformation is possible if more and more people become soul concious which means we are all same only thing is that we are all playing different roles on the stage of this earth. The day we understand this, our life will become very easy. Differences will vanish. Happy, peaceful, joyful, pure and powerful souls will emerge in all of us, hence no need to search for happiness and peace outside.]]></description>
