			<description><![CDATA[Respected Dadiji thanks very much for a wonderful thought given by you. If everybody read and realised them then this world will become heaven and there will be peace and no wastage of any thing. I have opened this site for the first time and find it strange to read such types of thoughts which give complete peace. Thanks.]]></description>

From today I'll honestly try to feel happy constantly and i will do this practicaly bcoz we read lot of good things , we listen lot of good things but we never do them practicaly. After doing we can feel whats really true.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om Shanti. I'm a regular student at Haidar Medlej and I'm very new there. I enjoy reading words of wisdom written by seniors. I felt my life had change when I start my learning at Haidar Medlej. I learn to appreciate myself even more and to put aside all the wasteful thoughts. Letting go is very hard. Most of the time, we do not realise that we are actually accumulating rubbish in ourselves when we get angry at what others do, hating them and complaining about them.We cannot change anyone; we just have to adjust ourselves. I'm happy I came to know God. Om Shanti.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Yes, wasteful thought fills us with waste because what we think we do and after doing it again and again it becomes our sanskar (habit).We should always connect with God (Shiv Baba) in order to purify our thoughts because without connecting with Him, it is not possible to have pure thoughts.We are like a battery which cannot charge itself and has to connect with energy source which is God.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om Shanti. Thanks a lot Dadiji for sharing these precious thoughts. As you said we need to stop seeing weaknesses of others, which is very difficult to do as our mind is habtual of thinking that way. As I have understood, by considering ourselves to be  a soul and connecting to God helps us to see the qualities of other souls and our connection with God also becomes stronger and we can always remain happy by doing this. Thank you so much..]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dear dadi,Thanks for the sweet message. God has given us the wonderful instrument called mind. This instrument has tremendous power in it. It is left to us about how to use it. Whether to use it for good constructive purpose or not. Mind is not your enemy, be always positive then automatically everything around you starts to appear like heaven.om shanthi..]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[It is said: your mind is your biggest enemy!Yes we should all focus our mind on God to get away from wasteful thoughts, but it is easier said than done! How can this culprit mind can focus on God, who has given us this life? So I enter into great confusion. Maybe there is some way out - I am not aware till now.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[It is very true. Also 99% of our wasteful thoughts are about the past and future, in our imagination. Most of them are due to false perception and fears and lack of faith in ourself or the goodness in life. And they lead to an unhappy and discontent present. Now there is awareness to recognise wasteful thoughts, its the first step. The next would be to see them for what they are- a waste, garbage.]]></description>
