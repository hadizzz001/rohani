			<description><![CDATA[Bina:  To be an instrument means to feel that when you serve others you do not feel that you are doing it, but that God is getting it done through you.  (just as a musician blows through the trumpet to make the sound - it is the musician that is blowing - the trumpet (the instrument) is the vehicle for the sound.  When you do an action in the remembrance of God, with no feelings of attachment to the outcome, or the feeling that you are accomplishing the task, then you are an instrument.  In this awareness your attitude, vision and actions are filled with humility because there is no 'I' or 'mine' involved.  ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dear Dadiji, I was worry sometimes the way I speak to my near ones because of anxiety. Some rough phases in past have made me like this. I will always remember this message Dadi: Be careful what you say to others. Be careful how you speak to others.As you said "Make your life such that on seeing you others are inspired by the way you are" , my grandmother is one, by seeing her I feeling like becoming like her. She was in BK for the passed 30 years, today she left her body, she is near God, Shiva Baba. When I was 6-7yrs old , she taught me to meditate. Om Shanti.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dadi Ji I agree your view on spiritual service. We have to identify each soul talents and train them in meditation and "deploy" them as a powerful and peaceful spiritual army (Shakti Sana). Om Shanti.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dadiji, after going through this message really it is possible for someone to provoke the feeling of spirituality in his or her life and to act upon this even in my life i am also in contact with these sayings from a long ago and after this period of life i am now slowly understanding what is really going on and now i can think upon many things of this concern but the thing or point at which i always stopped is that what we are doing here in short i want say that only one question that. Why was life started on this earth? I cant think on this or no ideas till today i got in my life..............]]></description>
