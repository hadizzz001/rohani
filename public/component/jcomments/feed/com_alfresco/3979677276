			<description><![CDATA[When we receive something good, we want to share it with others. We welcomed our foster child to our home in December 2011. He was lacking love of himself and had low self esteem. In such a short time he has turned such a new outlook on life. I wanted to share this with you. We try do things, small and large, without wanting anything in return, and take great delight in seeing the happiness on our young man's face! He is spreading his happiness to others too.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I have recently started a Raja Yoga meditation course at the Brixton centre in London. I am finding it truly hopefully and inspirational. I am a busy working mum, who finds it hard to grab time to relax and reflect on the important things in life. But the course is teaching me to continue to strive to be a better person for others around me and to recognise that I already have the knowledge to be truly happy, I just need to continue to learn to connect to my true self in order to achieve this happiness.I am very greatful to have the opportunity to realise this. Om Shanti]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[What are good actions? They can be simple.Can I tell you about a very small good action I do whenever I can?It's so simple yet the rewards are great.When I go to my supermarket, as I check out, I notice the name of the check-out girl or boy and as I look at them I try to understand a little about their life, past and present.As I check out, I always say, "Thank you Mary (or John), have a nice day".Their reaction is wonderful. I have acknowledged them as a human being, not just a supermarket robot.They look at me and with a big smile wish me the same. Two human beings connecting.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om Shanti.To finish ego and attachment,we should be soul conscious.If I truly identify myself as a soul in every rolls,situations and interactions,then I can finish ego.Ego is my false identity.In attachment,we sometimes feel happy and sometimes pain.To be always happy,we should be loving and detached in every situation and interactions.]]></description>
