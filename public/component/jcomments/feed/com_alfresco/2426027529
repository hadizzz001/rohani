			<description><![CDATA[Dear Anand, Thank you for your comment and questions. The answer to both questions lies in the proper development of another of the eight essential spiritual powers: the power of discernment, about which there is another article by Kiran Coyote. Each of these powers is developed through the practice of Raja Yoga meditation. If you have self-honesty, then deciding on the basis of any of the three principles mentioned would preclude you acting only in your own interests.]]></description>
