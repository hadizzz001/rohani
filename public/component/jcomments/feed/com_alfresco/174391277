			<description><![CDATA[naorem: These practices enable us to live in the world, while being detached.  Detached in the sense that you understand that you are a soul and that all others are also souls.  Nothing is really yours, all belong to God and are his children.  We have relationships with one another but are not in bondage, this makes for much more harmonious relationships with all living things.  Attachment brings sorrow true love brings freedom.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Vijayalaxmi.  It is good to know our own qualities, and if we are honest and true then whatever others may think will not affect us.  Being honest and truthful allows us to see what is needed in any situation and give us the power to bring what is needed to that situation.  Many of us easily get influenced by our own weakensess and the weakneses of others.  Meditation will help us to understand ourselves more deeply, enable us to connect to God so we can receive power from the source of all truth and love, thus brining benefit to ourselves and others.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Seema Monga:  Every soul has sanskara's that they have developed according to their cirucumstances and the habits that they have developed.  However,  all souls are origionally pure and full of the qualities of peace, love, happiness and wisdom.  Now is the time to re-emerge our origonal sanskaras.  Understanding that we are souls, children of the One Father and re-connecting with God the Supreme Soul, will remind us who we really are and sensitivity (in terms of becoming influenced and hurt), and hardness will melt away as we experience Gods love and understand that we are truely brothers and sisters, children of the One Parent.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[dadi is right, out of love, life existed and out of life, love existed. love and life are eternal and never cease to exist. we should love to love and love all life forms, since there is a purpose for every life form to exist whether we know the purpose or not. loves greatest definition is "give no pain and take no pain". hurt no one including the animals, insects, birds and all living inhabitants of the earth. be at peace to live at peace with all.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[It's the moments I am really quiet, reflecting on who I am, a conscient soul, reflecting on my dear Father, Baba, that I feel literally- 'the amazing me!!' The beauty of my own existence, the world, the people around me whom I so often, mistakenly, regard as being entirely else. It's like an undercurrent of purity, positivity which I know, & firmly believe, is eternal.Like Baba.Like everyone of the brotherhood.Like me.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[May peace be with all of us.Thank you for the spiritual teachings. As I read the words it went right through me and brought me into a time when I was like that as it described some times ago. Then life took a turn. I was getting exploited from many people in many ways. I then recognized that I got to get strong. But, it made me hard also. Now, that I understand more about human nature can be different from before. Now, I just can take them all with so called grain of salt. It is a wonderful thing that I find this site and article. I am , now sure that I am on the right path. Truly,]]></description>
