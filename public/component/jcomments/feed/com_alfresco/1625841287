			<description><![CDATA[Gurait  Experience comes with practice.  Intellectual knowledge is not enough as you have discovered.  Meditation is using your thoughts and feelings together, which create an experience.  I suggest you go to your nearest BK center where a teacher will advise you personally on how to go into the depth of the experience. If you live in Inida, then a center near you can be found at this website - brahmakumaris.com and go to contact us.  If you live elsewhere then on this website go to - Where Are We and then locations near you.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Helena: It can be difficult to find silence in today's world.  However the practice of meditation helps to detach from the outside distractions of the world.  To begin with to get some physical peace and quite, waking up before everyone in the household rises in the morning is a good time to practice.  Not just because it is physically quite at that time but also because there is less negative activity the vibrations are more peaceful and quite and you will find it easier to concentrate, helping you to find the inner silence you are looking for.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[my son is 7yrs old, he asked me "mum is life a puzzle?" I looked at him and said "no it is not, it is so simple, origin is godhead and destination is again the same". So every day we have to make sure we talk to him and say i am not lost on my way.  But this can be only done if we give sometime to him every day so it can become a habit. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[ Kapil:  It takes practice to focus your mind, so keep going and you will get results.  A way to still all the distractions is to say to yourself that this is your time with God.  All your distractions will be waiting for you when you are done and so you don't have to think about them now.  Once you have had that silent time with God then your perspective and response to your other concerns will have shifted for the better.  It is also important to feel Gods love and not just think about it intellectually.  We need our intellect and our feelings in meditation.]]></description>
