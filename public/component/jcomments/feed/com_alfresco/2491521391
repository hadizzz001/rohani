			<description><![CDATA[Mihir: If it is your duty to carry out such actions, then youshould do it with fairness and love, as a detached observer, with no personal judgment, but with the pure thought of bringing benefit.  Do it in such a way that the offender realizeshis mistake and would not want to commit the same offense again, because of hisown realization.  This would be an act ofmercy where both the one doing his duty and the one receiving the result of his ownactions would experience love and not sorrow; through spiritual understanding.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dadi, you are correct. But there are some situations when even performing official duties sincerely one may make somebody sorry.If an Income Tax officer catches somebody for tax evasion or a policeman arrests a person for a criminal offense, the arrested persons will certainly be sorry. In such situations what directions would you give.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Yes . . . Thank you Dadi Janki.. It really works when we decide not to take sorrow from others. This decision actually works as a filter wherein we absorb only happiness and filter out sorrow and enrich ourselves and become an observer of the scene.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[OmShanti....I got really inspired by the insights which were given by Dadi Janki. I started watching the program at Astha since two days back and got many new things to know about myself.. Now I know I am the creater and should hold all the responsibilities for myself first then family and then world... From now on I will try to think positive and will not allow any sorrow to get inside my soul.... OmShanti]]></description>
