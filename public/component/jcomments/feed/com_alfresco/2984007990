			<description><![CDATA[Rajesh Kumar Ojha:  It is good that you, your son and wife are taking the meditation course.  If you continue and bring this practice into your lives it help.  It may give your son more direction in life.  Every soul has there own time and as parents you can guide and show different options but ultimately the soul decides its own destiny.  Meditation will also help you and your wife to bring peace into your life.  We can only actually bring chage to ourselves and responding to situtations with peace and clarity will bring benefit.]]></description>
