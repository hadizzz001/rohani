			<description><![CDATA[Thanks for appropriate article for all. as such if we see towards the power of this two words "Adjust" and " Accomodate" we will realize and learn the lessons of spiritual churning inside within our souls. This teaches us the real location of whatever issue/problem/matter is lying within our minds and helps us to overcome them once you understand the terminology of these words..]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I enjoy how the progression of the first three powers leads us to have a healthy way to have the power accommodate, or merge and not resist. So many times as women we were taught to do this as part of our role. That is however, without the first three powers in my awareness and without those, I do not have the experience of inner self respect! The need for validation and people pleasing then sets in and so does sorrow and the lack of personal power, like being in a boat without a paddle tossed on the waves.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I liked the article very much, as it is very important to accomodate in a real sense. We all know that we have to accomodate with so and so, but "how" is very crucial to know.]]></description>
