			<description><![CDATA[thanks dadi, i was not able to understand properly if the mind is a part of body or the soul. but now it has become clear to me that our mind can come under the influence of the senses, and it is a part of soul and can be managed by conscience and intellect.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Situ: It is good that on reading Dad's messages you feel empowered.  However, we will not really be empowered unless we put spiritual wisdom into practice.  The nourishment we receive from listening is fleeting unless we digest it. (think about these things for ourselves).  The first step to connecting to God is to connect with ourslef, recognizing, thinking about, reflecting on ourself as a spiritual being of light energy.  In silence when we practice this awareness we are getting on the same 'wave length' as God, who is also of spirit and light energy . . . we then feel God, Baba's presence, Gods love and develop a close and loving relationship.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Priyanka Yadav:  Dadi resides at our headquarters in Mt. Abu. Rajasthan.  However she does travel a lot in India and abroad.  The best thing to do is to contact your local center and speak to them about Dadi's program and they should be able to tell you next time she is coming in your part of the world.  Dadi always likes to be accessible and does her best to achieve this.  ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dear Dadiji, Om Shanti.I am very new to the work and mission of the Brahma Kumarians having been introduced to your work quite recently. I attende the weekend retreat in Oxfordshire and was truly enlightened in many ways but chiefly about my self and the sanitised bubble I have inhabited for most of my life. I saw and experienced the true nature of humility and service in what others were prepared to do for me; I felt kinship and the unconditional love of others: it is something to which I aspire. In the mean time, thank you for the grace and warmth of your life and the wisdom of your words.]]></description>
