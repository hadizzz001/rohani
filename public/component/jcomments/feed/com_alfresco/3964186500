			<description><![CDATA[If your mother is not able to see the reality that family members see, or be convinced that she is safe and cared for, then she needs the help of a mental health professional. People need to feel fundamentally safe and secure before they can implement changes in their lives. Itâ€™s good that your mother watches spiritual shows, even if she cannot implement, because that reminds her of what life can be like once the mental health issues are addressed.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Hi. I need to talk about my mother. She watches your show but doesn't implement things in life. She thinks her son is plotting against her and taking all the money that my father has earned. She also thinks that no one loves her and is constantly trying to make herself feel bad because of it. She keeps saying she will fall in depression because of it. I'm our house everyone loves each other, but the negative side of her brain has overpowered so much that she thinks everyone is against her. I'm really concerned about her. Please tell me what to do.]]></description>
