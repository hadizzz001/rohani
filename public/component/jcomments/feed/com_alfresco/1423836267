			<description><![CDATA[I have been a regular observer or sister shivani must be for the past 4 yrs. I agree with my brahmakumari brothers and sisters. We should be soul consious but the inspirational messages have stopped and feel trapped into illusion (maya) again. Its difficult but not Impossible and that is the only way out for drained out souls in this Kalyugh]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dear Friends, Last week (30-Nov-2011-Wednesday) i was at Madhuban.  No words to express the joy and remarkable feeling which triggered my soul to know about me during Baba's milana. im lucky enough to meet Janki Dadi, Gulzar Dadi, Ratanmohini Dadi, Nirwair Bhai and many more great souls at Shanthivan mount abu, where they are doing astonishing seva for world peace, and welfare of this mankind. *****Om Shanti]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[In true silence the ego disappears and gives way to feeling the inner experience. We begin to understand our true nature. In that spiritual state we become humble and begin to trust that everything is in control by the Supreme power.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om shanti. Mike George was teaching us in Argentina about this. I got to experience during his workshop dead silence. I usually do that alone at home in my meditation room. It is bliss to meditate among other students and still make this comforting union with Baba. Your insights get this far. Gratitude to bkwsu Om Shanti Dadiji.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Respected Dadiji Very wonderful message for awakening of a 'dead' soul. But power of Maya is so trmendeous that it seems to be very difficult to attain this coscious stage at all time. It requires bliss of Supreme soul.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Today we aren't aware of our original nature. But is it so easy to realise our true form? I have watched a number of episodes of 'awakening with brahmakuaris'. But i realised that when i was used to watch them, i felt inspired   peace within myself. But as i am a student, so it wasn't possible for me to watch the programme regularly. When i am not able to be in touch with those inspirational messages i loose all the spiritual gains again.]]></description>
