			<description><![CDATA[Akash:  It is good to help others, and as you say it brings real happiness to give.  But we should also pay attention to completing our own work. It is good karma to carry out our work with accuracy, as it is our responsibility to do the work that we are getting paid for.  However whilst doing our work it is also good to cooporate and to help our collegues, this brings unity and it is also an opportunity to share the virtues and values we receive from God. This brings strengh to ourselves and others. In this way we do not need to ask God for help, but it is automatically received as we are using the gifts that we receive from God.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Recently, I have been following BK and appriciate the knowledge they are sharing with one and all. Though, certain suggestions/ advices seem impractical at times but yet workable with a proactive mind set. The three powerful 'Virtue' as outlined by Dadi dearest by no mean are incorrect but practice and embracing them religiously in day 2 day life is some difficult if not impossible. In any case, I personally remain indebted to dadi dearest and BK for exceptionally knowledgeble discourse on living quality life thereby addiding life to numbers and numbers to life we live. long live dadi dearest.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dear Dadiji, Many thnanks.  For me this is full of inspiration, challenge, motivation, peace, keeps me cool and added more spiritual well-being . . . My first visit  and attendence at a Raja Yoga center was at the Radio Club Colaba, Mumbai in 1992, Then I visited the Shiv Darshan Exhibition at Bidar District of Karnataka state.  I am proud to say this was a nice moment and the spiritual literature woke me up and added spirituality to my life once again.  Thanks!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[After getting out of rehab in May of 2010, I attended a few classes of Haidar Medlej in Banawa, Cebu City. My teacher was very great and helpful, insightful and understanding. I regret that I stopped attending, because I got a job with Convergys. Maybe one of these days I will return to the center to resume my studies. Peace and love. Om Shanti!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dear dadi, these are very true life principles. Really understanding others and helping them through all is God's gift and is wonderful service. One can get a true happiness by doing this. But I tend to give prioritiy to others, and do not get on with my own work.  I believe that God's (Baba's), love is always there.  But am I making a mistake by not doing my own work and asking for Baba's help?]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Very Inspirational thought by Dadi ji.Om Shanti. If we have patience,then we can maintain our stability of mind and can choose our proper responses in every situation and instead of being reactive,we become proactive in every situation. If we have tolerance, we can unconditionally accept the people, things and situations and then choose proper responses. If we are experiencing God's power and blessings, then we will be contented and be always full of happiness.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dear Dadiji, this is the most inspiring and motivating piece of advice you have given us, especially when we have lot of stress and uncertainties in our workplace and at home. The challanges will be there as the world becomes more and more complex and people around us become more aggressive and fierceful. However, with these three powers we can conquer our mind and thru our mind the world around us. Since the time I have been associated with BKs I have learnt to gradually acquire these powers and practice meditation regularly and undoubtedly have regained my lost peace and happiness.Om Shanti!]]></description>
