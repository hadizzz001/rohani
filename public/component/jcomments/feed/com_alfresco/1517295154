			<description><![CDATA[Debabata Deb:  When you make true effort and things don't seem to be working out, there can be different reasons for this.  The influence of past Karma may be affecting the reconciliation.  However, this can change with time.  Karma is action and so by seeing benefit, and bringing benefit to a situation, ultimately things move.  Love and forgiveness is a powerful force and sometimes love means sacrifice, with humility and compassion.  Actions done in this awareness create good karma transformation happens.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I really believe that thoughts are very powerful. What ever you are thinking it is manifesting at the same time. So always detect your thoughts. And be aware of your thoughts, because any thing negative you can change into positive. So first step is the awareness. Om Santi.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[lot of things are going wrong it has on control on one mind we have obserse the world as a witness as krishna told and have faith in god my faith in god cannot be different from other's faith and my faith is positive and creative just like others.when we realise that we have no control on outside world and attach the mind at a one place then we maintain our own stability and art of facing the disturbed situations developed and mind is placed at place where the we were born and this art of visulisation is good for ourselves and didi rightly said faith becomes force and produce better events]]></description>
