			<description><![CDATA[Katie, thanks for viewing the recipe. First of all, the frozen shredded coconut can be found in several places: regular grocery store specially in the Hispanic product freezer section, any Spanish store or Indian store.The process to obtain fresh shredded coconut you mentioned is a nice option. You can shred the coconut also in the food processor.The orange blossom water can be replaced by either lemon of orange juice, as long as is a citrus.It just gives a little extra tropical taste.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I could not find a couple ingredients: frozen, unsweetened shredded coconutorange blossom waterTo use whole coconut - make a hole w/drill (or hammer and nail) in one end of coconut and pour milk out [included in 4 cups of milk];then put the coconut in a plastic bag, close it, and throw it on the ground with some force to break it up. Small pieces are easier to handle. I took those pieces and used a cheese grater to grate fresh coconut.Used lemon juice instead of orange blossom water. Mild lemon taste - now curious about taste with orange blossom water.]]></description>
