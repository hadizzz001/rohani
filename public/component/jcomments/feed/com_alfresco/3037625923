			<description><![CDATA[Uttama:  As you follow the BK knowledge you will know that anger is a vice that we all have, and the more angry we become the more we cause sorrow for ourselves, first, and then thoes around us.  The more often we allow ourselves to become angry the deeper this habit becomes.  If your brother really wants to change this caracteristic he needs to connect to the qualities and power of peace that he has inside.  Meditation can help with this.  It is not a quick fix, but the main thing to remember is that blaming others, and feeling that we get angry because of what others do or say, will not solve the problem.  We have the power to change ourselves but it takes, self awareness, practice and determination.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Uttama:  We need to become well-wishers for ourselves and not rely on others.  If you relay on others for support then invariably they will disapoint us. Meditation helps us to understand our past and create a better future for ourselves.  If we live in the past then we repeatedly bring that into our present, and then from there we are creating the future for ourselves.  Forget the past, it is past.  With understanding create a better future. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[uttama:  It never helps to seek revenge.  By focusing on the problem or discomfort it makes it worse. Dadi's message is how to apply a spiritual solution.  Re-read it and reflect deeply on its meaning.  This may take some time but you, and the other person is worth it.  Revenge is a quick fix and the sorrow you give will come back to you.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Su: All souls are 'new' when they come into physical form for the first time - meaning they are pure souls.  Each soul has its part recorded in them like a seed.  Once the soul is 'planted', so to speak, the soul begings to act and its part unfolds.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Su.  The soul comes into the physical form (from the incaporeal world to the caporeal world) and is eternal - always existing - and therefore there are a finite number of souls.  Once it enters the physical world it takes rebirth entering the cycle of time. Each soul enters the physical plane at its own time - many souls have come into their physical form in the last 100 years or so, and so there has been a big increse in the population - these are what some call 'new' souls - 'old' souls are thoes who have taken more births and came into physical form at a time when there were fewer human beings. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[s d Sharma:In order to 'talk' to God we have to get on the same 'wave lenght' as God.  God is an incaporeal being and so to communicate with God we also have to become incaporeal, that is we have to understand oursleves to be incaporeal beings of light, a tiny spark of devine energy.  In this conciousness, this soul conciousness, we can 'speak' to God.  Both the soul and the Supreme Soul (God) are subtle beings and therefore the language would be subtle. So communication takes place through the pure subtle energy of thoughts.   This can be experienced through meditation.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[all problems, whether inner and outer problems have there solution on the inside. Developing positive thoughts starts from creating some positive thoughts at the early hours of each day, say 4am. Take little time to reflect on the topic, who am I? on hourly bases, most especially the points concerning the soul. When the mind becomes totally still like water, every problem becomes clear and the solution erupts from the mind. Meditate on the problem in deep silence and once the problem becomes clear, the solution flashes in the clearly. Only in a state of total peace through observing soul or God consciousness that solutions of problems emerge. Om shanti is the way.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om Shanti I have been practicing this knowledge since i was 10.  Today i am 22 and an engineer. During this complete journey i never felt that i was alone, it was always as if Baapdada (GOD) was watching me. From that time through meditation i felt so light in my daily studies and other activities that today when i see other people of my age tensed and worrying about the future, and who still cant feel silence for even one second, I thank Baba for being with me and also for making me capable to serve others through this knowledge also.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[It is very true , God doesn't expect us to rush to do things if we fully understand his wonderful plan, we try not do what our own mind says. Many times i observed if we rush to make decisions or do things too quickly, the results can be harder for ourselves and the results can be negative, so calm and patience will teach us how to deal difficult situations. God says do good actions and then forget about it, wait and see as a detached observer, then magic will happened. I have applied this to many situations and it worked. Om shanti "have Faith "]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Pratibha.  Anger doesn't help in any situtation it only makes things more confusing, we are not able to discern properly or make good decisions.  The origional quality of the self is peace, connecting to that peace in meditation is helpful, but there are also good anger management courses available. Seeking advise from a qualified councellor is also an option.   ]]></description>

Meditation will help to bring our thoughts to the present, becoming aware of yourself as a peaceful being.  Everything will work out, worrying is not helpful - we need to guide our minds to let go of worrying about what may, or may not, happen and be present to our lives now.  In the awareness of peace - create good thoughts and actions and the results will be good.]]></description>

Like a charge is surrounded by its electric field , we are also surrounded by a field   that field is created by our thought(whether -ve or +ve). In a broad sense one has 9 feelings and one's thought decide the way to use it   that are: love, affection, anger, gratitude, respect, trust, fear, grief, joy.]]></description>
