			<description><![CDATA[Aashima:  When we are constantly critisized it is easy to be come disheartened and create a sense of low self esteam.  However, people often critizize others because they have a critical natrue and would also be critical towards their own self too.  They would therefore not be very happy people.  Because someone offers you a rotten apple (critical words) you do not have to take it!  Each soul is unique and has specialities - when we focus on the negative in ourselves or others we, as Dadi's message says, we sully our attitude.  Have faith in yourself, and others will have faith in you.  Have faith in others and give them the gift of good wishes and pure feelings.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om Shanti. I honour you Dadiji for your pious thoughts and messages. I believe that these messages are related to the experiences which I, we, or anyone have gone through or goes through in our day today life and can be handled with a very calm state of mind. Which is what is taught in your teachings. I have a very low self esteem and I think I can improve it if you help me to come out of it.  I am in this state is because of non stop critisizm of my work in the office even after putting alot of efforts. Maybe the fear of seniors and their remarks is hindering my capacity. I want to happy. Kindly Help me.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Anup: There are different types of silence.  A silence which is blissfull and peaceful comes from the awareness of knowing who we really are - spiritual beings, beings of light filled with the qualities of love, peace, truth, purity and happiness.  The practice of meditation helps us to connect to our true self and also to others in a meaningful way.  The silence that comes from non-interaction brings loneliness and emptiness.  We belong to a human family and it is important to connect with others.  Perhaps if you you are finding this to be difficult then it would help to get some professional help.  To learn to mediate contact a BK center near you - in India go to brahmakumaris.org and for the rest of the world - bkwsu.org ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om Shanti,I am a less talkative person, I talk very very less in whole day. Even i don't have any friends.So i remain silent the whole day, But this silence instead of giving Bliss & Peace has became a Obstruction. Its making me uneasy all the time. Its making me as if i am completely lost. Its making me as if i have became Dump. Its making me fearful. Its creating negativity within me.Why is it so?Thank You...!!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Mousumi;  When we remember the things from the past, especially thethings that we have felt hurt by, this will definitely bring more sorrow.  If we do not want this to continue to happenthen we have to make a commitment to create a new and better future.  Every soul is Godâ€™s child and is worthy oflove.  God is the embodiment of love andhates no-one.  In fact He loves usdespite our faults.  By bringing thelight of our inner beauty and peace into our awareness, we remember who wereally are, a being of light and peace, and can move forward in life with aloving and forgiving nature.  Forgiveyourself and the other, it is the past. We are the master of our minds, our minds belong to us and so, with lovechoose to think good things and give blessings and good wishes to all.  This will in-turn bring you the happiness and well-being you are searching for.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I liked what you said Dadi, but i still find it difficult to forget my traumatic past and forgive the person concerned. At times i feel maybe i am to be blamed, i am imperfect, ugly, no one can love me, so it happened. Sometimes i feel god hates me, so punishes me with all this pain. how do i get some peace, get rid of all that bottled-up anger, sadness inside, Dadi?  I laugh, behave normally outside to hide it all, but it's killing me from the inside, effecting my physical well-being too..]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Fela: Discussing "bad" thingsthat happen to one is a form of therapy, and can be used to understand what hashappened to us. However once we have understood -- from a spiritual perspective- when we go over and over the bad things that happen to us in our minds, it isactually like re-living those same things over and over again - bringing thosesame things from the past into the present with all the feelings of unhappinessand hurt we experienced and therefore reinforcing this in ourselves makes itmore difficult to let go of the hurt that is damaging us, and impedes ourprogress.In terms of the context of what Dadi is saying here, she is speaking about howwe can serve ourselves and others through our attitude and vibrations by goinginto silence, being with God and focusing on what is good, be it a situation oranother person and not contributing to anything " bad" by repeatingit to ourselves or others.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Nisha:  There are times when we have to speak to others in an official capacity - but this can still be done with love and respect for one other.  If we understand that we are both souls who are playing our parts, and each is a child of God, then when we have to say something - our awareness, attitude, and vision will be loving and detached. When we speak to each other in this way there is much more acceptance of what is being said, we  accomplish what ever it is we are setting out to accomplish through that conversation, and there will be success for the one we are speaking to and ourselves.]]></description>
