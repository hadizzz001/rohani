			<description><![CDATA[Dipti:  It takes time to change deep seated negative habits and beleifs, but consistant endeavor will produce results.  Understanding who you really are and experiencing this consistantly will bring you to your goal.  However, their will be people, situations and your own negative sanskara's that will come to test your progress.  See them for what they are, test papers and then you will pass.  Have faith and trust in yourself, keep God's company and enjoy the drama of life.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Humility is a state of no-ego, no-pride, no-arrogance and no-sense of I am this or that! Humility is a gem of increase and abundance. Humility uplifts. We need to be humble if we really have to serve anyone or humanity. Humility is not to feel superior or inferior inside. Humility is not to compare our age with the age of others before we act, but to always act peacefully and with love. Om Shanti]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[om shanti dadiji, infact these qualities of human beings which makes them divine are missing now a days. we are not able to recognise the truth which is hidden inside us. When we become soul conscious, we can recognise and feel these virtues and values and imbibe these divine virtues. a lot of courage, power, and constant effort is necessary and rajyog helps us to imbibe these virtues by receiving power from the father shiv baba. Instead of wearing jwellery of metals we should wear the jwellery of divine virtues which are ever sparkling and eternal and money can not buy this jwellery of virtues.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dadi, You are a great example of humility.In your book wings of the soul you say if you have all the virtues except humility you will be a virtuous human being who is arrogant about your virtues, however as someone who is all virtuous, as well as humble you will be an incarnation of the divine.]]></description>
