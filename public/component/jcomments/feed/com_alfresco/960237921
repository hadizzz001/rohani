			<description><![CDATA[kaamini:  the past is the past.  If we keep thinking about it, it becomes the present.  Forgive yourself, forgive the other. Mistakes are made but if you do not make the same mistake again you have learnt from it.  If you feel that the mistake cannot be rectified then it can't. Do good actions now and fill your mind with good wishes and pure feelings and you will be benefiting yourself and the other, and creating a better future.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[As long as the soul occupies the body, thinking is natural. The problem starts when the thoughts starts driving us instead of the other way round. We become so dependent on our thoughts that our touch with soul, subconscious and super conscious mind, is lost. The conscious mind is a good servant but a bad master. We have got to beat the conscious mind at its own game. Engage your conscious mind with thoughts of soul consciousness and God. Slowly we will get connected to the sub conscious mind and that will manifest itself through enhanced eight powers. Om Shanti.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[When we realize ourselves to be a soul -  soul concious, we realize our immortality; the is soul can never be destroyed, there is no 'death' we change our parts, our costumes (bodies) as we take on different roles in the unlimited drama of life. God, the one who never has a body of his own and is constant in this awareness has no fear.  Connecting to God (ShivBaba) in meditation increases the experience of peace in our lives, and as a loving presence helps us to understand our fears so we realize them to be 'paper tigers'.  A daily practice will increase your capacity, remembering God, our parent with love is natural.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Deepthi:  Understand that you are a peaceful soul.  Emerge that experience.  When peaceless or wasteful thoughts come in the mind, direct your mind to emerge thoughts and feelings of peace.  In every moment of life there is a choice - choose to be calm.  This is a special time when you can receive help from the Supreme - it takes one step of courage, and you receive 1,000 fold help. The first step is yours to take.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[We listen very less and talk more . Before some body starts telling something we cut them without lestening with preconceived notions. Even god has symbalically given one mouth to talk and two ears to listen which indicates one to talk and double to listen. Dadi is excellent in her giving directions one should follow Om shanti.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Appollo and Soya: Make your mind your best friend.  Our thinking comes from our consciousness.  In our original state of being we are pure, peaceful souls.  Spend time in this awareness and gain experience through mediation.  It is not that we stop thinking completely, but in this pure awareness the thoughts that arise are peaceful.  Because we are peaceful and content we will not be drawn into the jungle of desires, wasteful thoughts and worry.  We tend to spend so much time thinking over the same things again and again - thinking something once is enough.  The practice of soul consciousness stops this habit of thinking too much.]]></description>
