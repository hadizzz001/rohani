			<description><![CDATA[I've tried meditating for some time now - almost a year - and I am not connecting with God. I'm not sure what to do in the midst of silence. Create pure good thoughts? Concentrate on one single thing, like my breathing? Or to slow down my thought processes and just observe? Well, I'm quite confused...anyone have any suggestions?]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Shadi Masokoane,Contentment in life comes from within your self; you haveall these qualities you are searching for; spending more time with yourselfwill help.  For this a daily practice ofmeditation is good.  Relying on anyoneelse for your happiness, will not bring the stability you are looking for.  The more you get to know yourself; the morefaith and confidence in yourself you will develop.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[This reminds me of the time when while solving a complex problem, sometimes the solution does not come even if you spend all your time thinking about it. You RECEIVE the answer at the time when the problem it not in your mind. Trust in the Supreme Power who will carry you in the worst of times and keep you close to his benevolent heart.Peace.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Too often we are fearful of silence .. fearful of going within because of what we may find. From my experience, it is by going within and find our inate qualities that we are able to emerge with the 8 powers Dadi Janki spoke about. She is an inspiration to me!]]></description>
