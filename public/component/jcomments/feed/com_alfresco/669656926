			<description><![CDATA['we need (at this time) to emerge the nature of the pure peaceful world' Dear Dadi Janki: For a decade you've inspired me as once again today to clearly understand the more GOOD we 'feed' our mind, and the more negativity cannot enter it; ergo, we then for ourselves and others emerge as models of the nature of a pure and peaceful world.Thank you for your WORLD service.

			<description><![CDATA[Om Shantivery inspiring message which needs to be implemented in a true spirit. However we often forget that we belong to the Ocean of Peace, (God) and we come from the Land of Peace, (the original home of souls) which changes our behavior in certain moments. If we always remember our belongings, no way we can be away from Peace and Love.Thank You Dadiji]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Thank you Dadi for the lovely message. We are all experts in arranging food for the body, but we often forget food for the mind is equally important. That's the reason we don't feel peace in our lives. Only if we constantly provide our mind with spiritual knowledge, we will be in constant reminder of the ocean of peace we come from. And love and peace will flow out automatically.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dear Dadiji, this is a wonderful message and thanks once again for showing us the right path to lead towards spirituality. Many times we fill our mind with garbage and suffer the consequences but when we do have positivity and hope in our mind we feel delighted and elevated. Thanks once again for reminding us of making our mind pure and peaceful.Regards]]></description>
