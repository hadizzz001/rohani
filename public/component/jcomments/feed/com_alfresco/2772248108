			<description><![CDATA[Nirmal Kanti Das;  The mind is in the Atma - soul.  It is one mind, without dimension, a point of light energy and has no back or front.  The soul is eternal, when it enters a body for the first time it is pure an illuminated.  Through time as it becomes influenced by matter it looses its purity and its power to discriminate between truth and falsehood.  At this time when we connect our mind to God (who never takes birth and is therefore uninfluenced and remains pure) we get the strength, love and power to become our true pure illuminated self again.  ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[RK Rajikumar and Sanjay yadav:  Dadi of course has good wishes for everyone and so you would be included in that.  It is your own spirituatl endeavor that will bring you the most blessings and power.  This is called having mercy for yourself.  It is good that you are both concerned to do this and if you bring it into practice more and more you will recieve the fruit of that effort.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om Shanti, when I listen to the soul-stirring discourses of the 'Brahma Kumaris' in the Peace of Mind channel,I feel peace and bliss flow like 'taila-dhara' in the whole of my within. In the course of listening the pure and blissful discourses,an immense treasure of courage in fear,exhilaration in morbidity,strength to restore me from worldly sufferings.I am still to be absorbed in pure meditation as when I sit for meditation,all worldly affairs occupy my mind. Bless me.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[May I think that at the back-end of my front-end mind there exists a illumined mind. Is the front-end mind an external mind that creates thoughts and ideas when illumined mind gives power to discriminate.Is this that that this illumined mind gives solution to the problems,the external mind can't.The light illumined mind gets from is a very very higher source. May I perceive that this higher source is our primordial Being, our Atma ?]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[when we consider our self as a soul, a peace loving soul then we automatically connect to super soul(parmatma). when it happens we get the answers of questions like who am I?, whom I belongs to?, why am I here? etc. Brahmkumaris are the best platforms from where we can get spiritual knowledge and make ourself soul conscious. thanks a lot to dadiji and all didijis who are making this world more and peaceful and beautiful. you all are true daughters of god.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om shanti. Awareness of the self such that we realise through introspection and silence that " I am not my eye, my ear, my nose, my month, my bones, my blood, my body, my thoughts, my feelings but I am a soul, radiant light, full of ever flowing energy" is a key awareness. We become who and what we think we are. Think peace, love, power, words of great wisdom and purely. Om shanti]]></description>

We should have taking charge of the driver of our bus (Life) to control the situation and move mind to the passanger seat than we can get the peace in our life.]]></description>
