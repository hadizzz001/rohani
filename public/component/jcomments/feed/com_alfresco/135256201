			<description><![CDATA[Simmi Taneja: Being gentle and kind is a strengh and not a weekness.  If we feel disempowerd by another then it is because we are being subservient in some way, by the other or by a situation.  We have to check our motives and attitude.  Are we doing something just to please another, or because of attachment.  We should choose to do something because we know it is the right thing, based on our spiritual principles.  ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Nirmala:  To forgive can take a lot of strengh and understanding, which builds capacity and makes you strong from the inside.  From this stance you cannot be deceived, you stand in your own dignity and truth. if anyone takes you for granted that is their lack of understanding and weekness.  Being gentle and forgiving is a benevolent quality.  You do what you can to help others but you never let go of your principles.Karma:  What ever actions you have done in the past, whether from a past life, or yesterday you will receive the fruit of that.  Good or bad.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Thanku dadi ji for such simple and crisp description of being spiritual. The step by step transformation has been put in such few words that it has become a "saar" of whole concept. People out of their ignorance remain deprived of such divine messages. Thanku once again.]]></description>
