			<description><![CDATA[Good morning dear Dadi, the ideas of actors, drama and God are so wonderful they fill me with high self esteem. It is only God's power which has a deep bonus. I have practically experienced the more problems we encounter in day to day life the more our love goes on increasing. because we have seen and experienced, that living in this world we can float like a lotus flower whose roots are deep but makes itself detached.  Likewise if we feel our karmic account to be balanced and look at the drama as a detached observer, then only we can enjoy the world drama so beautifully.om shanti]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dearest Dadi - Om Shanti,Thank you for all your blessings and the most beautiful and inspiring thought to take us through our day...I really lookforward to meeting you in person, with gods will hopefully very soon. I heard your voice for the first time during last Sunday's early morning meditation session when you spoke to us all from Amirtsar... hearing your voice just touched me inside as if i have found something that I had been looking for so long. May God bless you with best of health and always be there to teach us the path to GOd. Surinder]]></description>

In the past the Sardinia was called Ichnos, that mins "footplrint", because it's the footprint of God. So here God leaved a mark for all the world. We are very like living here!

			<description><![CDATA[good morning dadiji, thanks for making us aware of our own being and making us feel who we are. being a science student i never believe anything blindly but after reading and going deep into your daily messages it enriches my soul. till today all of us live through a different attitude and different belief system. every body know there is a supernatural force acting but you have given us the proper guidance and saying that all the souls are important you make us feel great. thanks dadiji om shanti]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I am so happy to see that you are still in your earthly body. I was there as an invited guest in the late 1980's. At that time I was in my full-time chiropractic clinic in Singapore. While I was at Mt.Abu, I felt the most peaceful and high vibrations I had experienced on earth in this incarnation.I have been planning to look for the school online, and as Oneness pulls us back, I received a world leter from Patti C about world meditation and gathering on 10-10-10. Mentally i have returned to your holy campus many times. I am now in USA and think of coming again though I have body pains.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Beautiful sentiments - thank you for spreading such good energy across world. Your messages of positivity, love and peacefulness have a power to reach to people across the world who are seeking and needing spiritual nourishment. Your words have wings that can carry them towards a global audience, helping to heal humanity and just as importantly, a secondary healing of the planet itself. "Namaste" [The Divinity within me perceives and adores the Divinity within you.]]]></description>
