			<description><![CDATA[Maharaj:  Self realization is a practice of being in the awareness that you are a soul.  A point of concsient energy, a living being, separate from this body, but experiencing life through the body.  God is not within.  However, in order to connect with God, we need to become introverted, remove our intellects from the gross "outside' world and become subtle, that is, become soul conscious and remember God.  God is also a subtle being of light a concsient being, however 'He' doesn't have a body of 'His' own, so to communicate with God we need to get on the same wavelength.  Through the practice of meditation we can achieve this.  If you are keen to find God, we suggest that you find the nearest Haidar Medlej center and take the meditation course, this will help you on your journey and is, we believe, the fastest possible route.]]></description>
