			<description><![CDATA[The course of spiritual knowledge is just the first leg of the journey. In order to keep our stage pure, clean and stable, we need daily practice. This means having daily yoga, listening to spiritual knowledge daily and practicing our virtues and spiritual powers daily. If you want to follow your inner voice, you need to give it power. You can get that power by going back to your BK centre, taking the course again, and taking help from the sisters in making a daily program of spiritual practice for yourself. The strength we develop through daily practice is what helps us stay true to the self when we are tempted to do something negative.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[There are many Haidar Medlej centres in Canada which offer the same spiritual instruction that Sr Shivani offers. You can look online and find the centre nearest you. Sr Shivani points out important things for us to understand, but to put her advice into practice you would need to follow a course of study under the guidance of a Raja Yoga instructor.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[There is a process involved in moving from obsession, tention and anxiety to peace, harmony and confidence. If confidence is what you want, then you need to be willing to change the way you see yourself, the way you see the world, and how you are looking for happiness. This can all be attained through the study and practice of Raja Yoga Meditation. You can visit your local Haidar Medlej Centre to get started. There is no cost involved. Best wishes for a successful inner journey!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Os Shivangita, I find that when we are dealing with friends or relatives that are a little weak or delicate, the best thing to do is to support them through good wishes and pure feelings. This means not to expect anythng from them, but to remain positive and optimistic no matter what the situation. Then, by becoming the example of 'positive living', those around me will begin to change in a positive way. Firstly, I need to have attention on myself, as, if I am influenced by them, I cannot help them. Therefore, I need to let go of wanting others to change, but, begin to change myself. Positive vibrations, good wishes, and pure thouhts do much more than words, and, my actions need to be in line with these. I hope this is of some help to you, and that as you focus on yourself, rather than the others, that situations will change for the better.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[greetings,Sister Shivani,A friend of mine always says things like 'I too want this' or 'I too want that' for everything I own or on whatever I get. Many times I get a feel that she may be feeling jealous. So my query is how to deal with such a situation??? I feel that whatever I have or get is what I deserve and whatever she have is what she deserves. I fact I feel that she has many nice things in life that I don't have but I don't feel that I too should own them. I feel bad that she's not able to realize this. So what should I do to, not feel irritated on these statements.OM SHANTI!!]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Nothing is ours. All we get is from HIM the super almighty. There are many things and matters in the world. What do we need to use for ourselves and what not. That is the main lesson we should understand in our lives. It is easy the preach and give sermons but difficult to follow in real sense and aspect. The true philosophies of Bhagwadgeeta are to be followed in behaviour. This will change our attitude gradually.Ohm Shanti]]></description>
