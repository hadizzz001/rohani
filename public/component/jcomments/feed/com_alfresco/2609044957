			<description><![CDATA[Anil:  When starting meditation it can be challenging to quite our minds and focus, as our minds have been used to running all over the place.  However with practice this will happen.  Meditation commentaries will help you to focus -  you can follow the commentary with your mind,  listening to the words with your mind and feeling the experience of those words.  It is useful to practice meditation at the same time each day and create a corner in your home for this practice - so that you create a habit and it is easier to settle down.  You can find mediation commentaries from your local BK center or order on line from this web site.  ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Dear Dadiji, Since the time I have come into this knowledge, there is less of confusion and more of contentment and it seems there are abundance reasons and things that could provide one with happiness and joy thru own contentment and service thru thoughts and actions towards other. In fact it is so easy to remain away from the vices and remain intoxicated and in rememberance of GOD, it is just a matter of practice and faith.We are so very thankful to the group and your esteemed self for guiding us thru to remain happy and contented. Thank you so much!Regards,Raajive ]]></description>
