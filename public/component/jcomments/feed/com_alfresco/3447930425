			<description><![CDATA[The ideal way for your daughter to get married would have been for the family to be involved in choosing a good marriage partner. However, that didnâ€™t happen, and now she is married. So we need to look at what is ideal, given the present situation. The more accepting and supportive her family is, the happier and stronger and wiser she will be in married life. She still needs you. She still loves you. Encourage your family to work together to make her marriage a success.]]></description>
