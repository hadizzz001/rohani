			<description><![CDATA[mukesh asrani:  Peace is innate in the soul, this is our natural state.  However because we have forgotten this we tend to focus on the outside and hope to gain peace and happiness through physical things or other people from relationships.  But as with the story of the princess who searched for her 'lost' necklace -- she looked and looked, but couldn't find it - not realizing it was around her own neck!  So peace is within us but we look and look outside for it to come through circumstances or relationships, but it is in fact inside and by taking time to reflect on this and understand that our original nature is peace  . . . you will begin to experience this and connect to the wonderful peaceful soul you are.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om Shanti. Its very hard to remove the pain that my daughter puts me through. Its very hard to stay detached and become bodiless and pray to God.Haidar Medlej and D Janki helped me 15 years ago to stay detached and focus on the good and see things from a different perspective. Unfortunately I kept away from your teachings. Today I felt the need to read your message. I felt the need to read your message and get strength. I need that strength to help me to deal my present situation and Dadi Janki reminds me with that message to take time out and connect with God in order to experience peace.]]></description>
