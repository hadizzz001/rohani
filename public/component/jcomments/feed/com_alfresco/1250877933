			<description><![CDATA[To stay positive and peaceful in big situation requires first practicing in small situations. Our ability to be detached yet involved grows over time, and increases as we practice with bigger and bigger challenges. One needs to realize that we are spiritual beings, not part of the material world. Things constantly change in the material world but we do not need to change along with them. We can choose a response that maintains our own inner health and also helps other people. Most Brahma Kumaris centres offer a course in Positive Thinking which explains how to manage our thoughts and feelings so that they lead us in a positive direction.]]></description>
