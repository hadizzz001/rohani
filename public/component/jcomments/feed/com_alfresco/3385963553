			<description><![CDATA[What an article!!! I felt like meditating while reading this.As said in one of the commnets, I am also facing a nasty and unbearable experience in an organisation. So, I decided to leave it. I was under constant dillema to leave it or not. But after reading this article, I have made up my mind to find out real powers of myself and not being judged by others by your position,your job. I got a new direction to let my thoughts towards....Thank you so much...OM SHANTI...LOVE YOU ALMIGHTY....]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[It is so amazing that, after regularly listening to the BK sessions on Aastha channel and doing the Shiv Baba connection meditation, I experienced TRANSFORMATION, INSIGHT and INSPIRATION. As I read this article, I realized that what I am going through is because of connecting to GOD. I had had such a nasty experience in another organization that I had given up on God and I had decided that I would not go searching for him, that if He is there He would have to come knock at my door and He DID!!!! THANK YOU SWEET LORD!]]></description>
