			<description><![CDATA[Bhavesh Maheshwari:  The mind can be like a wiled horse and so it is necessary to train the mind with love and understanding.  Raj Yoga meditaion is a very good method for this.  It teaches how to make our mind our freind and to have elevated thoughts and pure feelings towards the self and others.  It teaches us how to connect to the Supreme Source of spiritual power so that we have the power to transform.  Over time we have become influenced by negativity and so our thoughts and feelings will be such.  Raj Yoga purifies the mind and allows us to think and feel more positively towards the self and others.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Yes, it is a waste of energy to change others, instead indeed fill your thoughts of good feelings for them and then let go. I have found this to be a very useful practice. My viewings of BK Shivani has borne this deep within me. This is so easy once you see the benefit you get from this. Change yourself instead and the world changes around you!!!

			<description><![CDATA["It's a waste of time to think to reforming others"? How this can be true? Even you yourself want to "reform" (transforming/enlightening) others by your teaching. How then, it will become waste of time? "We change "ourself"!! How is that possible to change your "self"? Your self is what you are. That "self" must be in connection with the "Supreme Self". Once your "self" is in connection with the "Supreme Self" then everything should be fine. Why need to change your "self"? We do not need to change ourself but only the position of ourself in relation with the Supreme Self. Everyone must change?]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Om Shanti Dadi....this is not just a message but this is the answer of all kind of problems in the world....we always think that its easier to change others and find it very difficult to think about ourselves....and definitely it does not works...and we become frustrated...we ourselves add on our problems...but to change ourselve, to love ourselve, to talk with our own inner self is the easiest exercise to do and top of that it provides immidiate happiness, peace and confidence.....i really wanna follow it i am starting practice it. Dadi please always shower your blessings on us....with Love]]></description>
