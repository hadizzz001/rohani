			<description><![CDATA[Om Shanti..Thank you BK Janki for your simple message of peace. In a world of turmoil peace is opposing the chaos. Peace keeps us still so that we can know Father better, and remain in that "Feeling Great" state. Thank you for your free book, Feeling Great, that I received from "The Beautiful One", Sister Jayanti. What a gift to my life, my soul, my world. The book and the talk changed my life for the better. She is a precious soul. Now I walk with a strength, courage, and a newness, feeling in charge, more mastered, and in love with my new life. Blessings of Peace to All.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Monica:  Om shanti.  Creative people are often sensitive.  Sensitivity is a good thing when it means we can catch the subtle aspects of spiritual wisdom.  Meditation helps to develop this spiritual sensitivity and emerges the wisdom from within the soul.  Meditation also helps us to protect ourselves from negative vibrations, be they from ourselves, a situation, or another person, when we keep practicing this, as with any practice, we become more accomplished.  As we spend time with ourselves in meditation we begin to know and trust ourselves and recognize that we are a unique and powerful soul, a child of God, and as such have the power of truth, love, peace, and purity within.  By connecting in meditation with God, the Supreme Soul, our spiritual parent, we can also access God's imperishable qualities.  As we know and trust ourselves more we will understand and trust others also. In this way our spiritual influence too spreads and this gives strength to others.  Our mothers are indeed special and have a lot of love for us.  With patience it is good to encourage any of our companions not to gossip - as this is a waste of time and energy and also causes harm to ourselves and others - as we spread this negativity into the atmosphere.  By listening to gossip we are actually encouraging the other and so we have to pay attention not to do this.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Urva: Unconditional love is challenging as one always has some expectation, which when  not fulfilled brings sorrow.  God is the only one who has complete unconditional love.  Spending time in God's company by connecting to him through meditation can help bring us out of the ocean of sorrow.  For this we first have to understand ourselves, and what is our purpose.  You may like to try learning Raj Yoga Meditaion which is available at your local Brahma Kumaris Center. ]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I believe that each and every creation of god has its own purpose of living.I’m still searching for the purpose of my life, I found it once but lost it when I thought it was my destiny but I was wrong. It’s painful when get to know that True Love never exist, yes true love has no expectation instead of loving the person as they are, and there’s only one expectation as return “unconditional love”. When heart get hurts, impossible to sail in boat called life,Difficulties, challenges that faced, drowning our self deep into ocean called sorrow and it’s difficult to come out from this feeling. How to handle this situation, please advise me.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Samita:  True love has no expectation but loves the person as they are.  Attachment on the other hand causes a lot of sorrow when the object of that attachment disappoints us.  The first step to forgiveness is to step back from the situation and as a detached observer understand from a spiritual perspective, and decide how to respond in a way that will bring benefit to all concerned, including yourself.  Each soul has their own part to play in this drama of life and every action we choose to do have its consequences - the best way to forgive is to let go of the past and understand what we want to create for the future.  Relying on others for your happiness and functioning in this world will inevitably bring sorrow.  God is the Ocean of Love, Forgiveness, and Mercy, draw power from Him in meditation and you will bring strength into your life and through this, bring strength to those who are in connection with you.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Arpita:  Yes it is challenging to be peaceful when there is so much chaos in the world which is why in her message Dadi is emphasizing the importance of taking the time to connect with the peace that is inside ourselves - original to the soul.  We need to access this, experience this, and bring it out into the world - to give support to the world.  The reason the world is in so much chaos is because human beings are - the world will be come more peaceful, when we do.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Deepali:  Only God can really give us unconditional love.  However, we can endeavor to give and take pure love by understanding that all souls are God's children, brother souls, beings of incorporeal light.  In this awareness, and with no attachment, and no expectations we are able to give without the thought of return.  Having pure feelings and good wishes for all souls in a practice that will bring us close to God.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA["Om shanti"  (I am a peaceful soul) - is the simplest and highest medicine in the world.  It's a tablet (pill) for all-in and all-out sorrow. God's ever flowing love for His long lost and now found Children is always the starlight upon our faces. "Love all and hate none". I am striving to achieve unbreakable remembrance of God (Baba.) I pour rays of my heart to all God's children with love, in all corners of the world. I wish us well to serve with the power of endurance until the dawn of a new world. Let's keep our minds toward the Home of Lights. Greetings of Om Shanti to all the Dadis and the "world transformers through self transformation"]]></description>
