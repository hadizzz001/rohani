			<description><![CDATA[So well said. This is very apparent in India, where mega-rich and the mega poor are in co-habitation side by side. There is extreme consumerism and amassing of wealth with complete apathy for others thereby making poor the poorer and rich the richer. The whole social and moral fabric is detroyed at the cost of the whole nation. The poor are dying like ants below the wheels of rapid race for modernisation. When the backbone of a country is crippled, can it go on forever? Can one human class go on rampaging and exploting their fellow human beings forever? Will this population boom be sustained?]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Interesting study. To my mind, most of ills are because the cycle or gap between action and result of the damage is years or even decades. We need to share case studies of good as well as bad cause and effect relationship which common man can understand. Page 3 of a newspaper carries news on wrong deeds or good deeds. Perhaps a deep down sharing of what led to this may create a role model for others not to follow the path.]]></description>
