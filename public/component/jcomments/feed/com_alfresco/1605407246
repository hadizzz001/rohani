			<description><![CDATA[To lengthen the experience of soul concisous.  Practice whenever you have a moment.  Change your conciousness from being a body to being a soul experiencing your life through your body.  The more you practice the longer you will be able to hold onto this experience.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I do not understand when  I read the other persons comments. "psychology is connected with MIND and spiritual reflection is connected with SOUL".  The question of the existence of the soul is not poved by anybody. I belive that the soul is only imagination - Man made high level imagination:  The wonderful combination of matter and energy is life and the existence of the soul is only man made application.  I beleive that this organization teaches this as do other isms do.]]></description>
