			<description><![CDATA[Holy Message of Dadiji captures the whole philosophy of the eternity.it is like that 'Aadi Prachin Abinashwrer maha anabik spandan'. I recall the French Mathematician turned Philosopher Rene Descartes'(1596-1650) who said," I had learned to think of something more perfect than myself...of which I was conscious and thus could of myself have become infinite,eternal,immutable,omniscient,all powerful and in fine have possessed all the perfections which I could recognize in God". Vivekananda also said,"Atma of all is the unmanifested Brahman" Manifestation of this unmanifested is to turn on light.]]></description>
