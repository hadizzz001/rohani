			<description><![CDATA[The basis of spiritual relationships is the understanding that we are all souls, not bodies. Souls experience love, and souls do not have gender. Therefore, the soul does not need sexual love, and cannot be satisfied with sexual love. Spiritual relationships are chosen when two people want to experience love in its highest and purest form. The Supreme Soul has no body, and therefore His love is always pure and unconditional. You and your boyfriend no doubt have very honest intentions in wanting to have a spiritual relationship. However, since you are both in bodies, the closer you are physically to each other, the stronger will be the pull of feelings of physical attraction. There are no “rules” about what you can and cannot do in spiritual relationships. If you want your spiritual relationship to succeed, then a top priority would be to structure your meetings in ways that nurture spiritual love and prevent a triggering of physical love.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Morning, I have started the meditation course at Brahma Kumaris in July 2016, I enjoy and love it a lot, I want to know more and more, as I want to be in peace, to feel peace, love, connection with the Supreme soul. There is one thing I want to know, with my boy-friend, we want to have a spiritual relationship. How can we have a spiritual relationship? At what frequency could we see us (we don't live together, we both have children from a previous marriage), we have make the choice for not having sex anymore, but can we sleep together? Can we touch us without having sex? Can we love us? Thanks for replying me as I want and I need to do my spiritual life well.]]></description>
