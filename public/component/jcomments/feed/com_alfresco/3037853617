			<description><![CDATA[Over time, we can change our self-image by learning about the true self and focusing our attention on our spiritual qualities. All human souls are children of God, and like our Father, beings of love, peace, wisdom and virtue. Life may have suppressed those qualities, but our divine qualities can never be destroyed. The more effort we make to find and develop our virtues and qualities, the easier and more enjoyable life becomes.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[To have a good life, spiritual study should be part of a holistic program that takes into account physical, mental, emotional, social and spiritual health. If one aspect of health is promoted at the expense of another, the person cannot feel balanced and healthy. If one person is ill and not in a position to leave the home, another person can attend the class and relate the essence of the class to the person who has stayed at home.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[“Who am I” and “What is my life all about” are the big questions in life. These questions need to be addressed systematically and over a long period of time. The wisdom one acquires in life comes from taking these questions seriously. For starters, I would suggest that you take the beginning course at your local Haidar Medlej centre. You will learn how to answer these questions from a spiritual perspective. When we start looking at our lives from a spiritual perspective, we value our lives more, and we become more interested in making our lives peaceful, purposeful and satisfying.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Attending daily class is a discipline that ones learns over time. Part of the learned discipline is paying attention, noticing important and useful points, perhaps writing them down, and then applying the learning during the day. People can doze off during class for a variety of reasons. If you notice that you are dozing off often, then it would be good to look at why you fall asleep. Are you bored? Tired? Unfocused? Once you understand the reason, you can take steps to correct it. Have patience and don’t give up.]]></description>
