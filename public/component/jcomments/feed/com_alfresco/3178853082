Once you answer these questions, your clarity and focus will lead you towards the path.

			<description><![CDATA[There is one Supreme Soul who resides in a place of light, and radiates the light of peace, love and bliss to all His children, the human souls. When we connect with the Supreme Soul and absorb that light, we become more like Him, that is, more filled with light, peace, love and bliss. Just as I cannot become you, you cannot become the Supreme Soul. We are each individual divine beings with great potential to experience and express our divinity while enjoying live on Earth.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[While it isn’t clear what is causing your father’s difficulties, the family can support him in becoming more stable. The family can help by not reacting negatively to him but rather staying calm, stable, detached and loving. When he is positive and relaxed, point out that this is his real self. Create a positive and peaceful environment in the home. Encourage him to look for solutions in restoring his positive personality.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Good questions. First of all, we should only follow things that we understand and feel will have a beneficial affect on our lives. Regarding onion and garlic, the point of refraining from them is to clear the head of substances that can interfere with our ability to come into the awareness of God. God is extremely subtle. The mind must be clear, clean and peaceful to pick up God’s subtle energy. Diet is one of many approaches to having loving relationship with the Supreme Soul. Ultimately, we each must decide how important that relationship is and how we can best maintain the relationship. And by the way, although garlic has some health benefits, it is toxic to the body. Information about this is widely available.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I'm still not following any way how to follow the God.But I like some of the knowladge of Om Shanti.here is my some question that I can't agree with it. Can God give me a perfect answer. 1.Yes I agree it's a peace of mind.But what is the connection between God and onion and garlic? According to science garlic is important for mind.? 2.By killing self satisfaction does it become blades by God? I mean when you are hungry we need food but we have to stay in constant because we are following Om shanti.? 3. If the suprem sole gives the knowledge the we need the way for belive can god shows the trust over him/her.? If the knowladge is same then why people shows different behaviours?]]></description>
