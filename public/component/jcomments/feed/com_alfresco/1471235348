			<description><![CDATA[pranam dadi ji,Thanks for sharing your experience.A good listener and observer are supposed have the knowledge of patience.When a person practice the technology of patience he/she gets the gift of tolerance from the soul of the world.By combing these two qualities the human being give birth to a virtue of contentment.All these comes through spiritual practices and the practice of non violence, the environment where we live and the practice of Raj Yoga which has mentioned in Bhagwat Gita by Lord Krishna.PRADIP]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Pranam Dadiji,Your sayings are time tested truths. But what happens when a thief enters your house? It is one's moral duty to arouse others to prevent theft. This is why monks throughout the world, who are endowed with these three qualities, yet they are the torch-bearers in any movement against social injustice. This is what we have seen in Myanmar and now in Tibet. Similarly, in our own country, saintly people like Annaji and his followers are fighting for justice, by sacrificing their patience tolerance and contentment, so that the next generation may again enjoy these three qualities.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Saroj:  Do not keep the knowledge of the powers and virtues locked away in your intellet.  Bring them into your practical life.  Choose to use patience, tolerance, or to be content in your life as you go through situations. This creates more power and confidence in the self.  As you choose to use these powers your experience of benefit and the changes it birngs in your life will grow.   These qualities and powers are coming from you, the soul, by using them you are drawing on them and bringing them to life.  This is a journey from the inside out.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[Amshul: In order to bring happiness and peace into our, minds, hearts and lives we need to let go of that which is ties us in bondage.  Even though sometimes it appears that somone else or somthing else is causing us sorrow - the feelings are ours and therefore are coming from our hearts and minds.  Meditation helps to clear away these bondages which cause us sorrow and confusion and connect us to the qualities that are origional to us, that of purity, peace, happiness. It is also through meditation that we can connect to God who is the constant source of all these qualities.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[I can not express my thought. Really... Really...Really... I am mad for God. Which way I shall express my thought. I got every thing. In our culture as a Hindu when a man dies and while carrying his dead body, the people - those who are carrying the body - say "RAM NAME SATAY HE" meaning death is certain. You should not go nothing except God. God is Truth. God is named with different names - Ram or Siva Baba.]]></description>
